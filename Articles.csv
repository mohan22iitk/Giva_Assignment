"HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is ""barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece´s exit ""almost inevitable"" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be ""manageable"", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.""The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,"" IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday. Dow member Chevron fell 4.0 percent, while oil-services giant Schlumberger lost 2.6 percent.Key US oil companies like ConocoPhillips and shale producer Continental Resources have cut their drilling budgets for 2015.Still, analysts expect US output to continue to rise this year, owing to investments that have already been made. That will put more pressure on crude prices.""I still think one of the primary drivers of the market is US oil production and I really don´t see US oil production growth slowing appreciably in the first quarter,"" Cooper said.

"SYDNEY: Oil prices fell 1 percent on Wednesday after the World Bank cut its economic growth forecast, helping extend a rout that saw prices touch a nearly six-year low the previous session.Oil and other commodities came under pressure after the weaker outlook from the Washington-based financial institution reinforced worries of a gloomy economic outlook at a time when oil markets are plagued by oversupply.""The global economy is running on a single engine ... the American one,"" World Bank chief economist Kaushik Basu said. ""This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.""February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1 was at $45.29, down 60 cents.""There's clearly a souring of sentiment towards industrial commodities and I think that's spilling over to oil today,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.""Potentially this selling is now being overdone, but today there's no sign of a turnaround,"" he said.Analysts said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent, and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said. The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.""Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,"" analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.""The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,"" ANZ bank said.

"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.

"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher.

Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didn´t see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""It´s too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh.

"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.

"NEW YORK: US authorities are investigating the credit rating agency Moody's over its glowing assessments of mortgage deals in the runup to the 2008 financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday.Citing people familiar with the situation, the newspaper said Justice Department officials had met with several former Moody's executives. It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

He added that prices could ""fluctuate by increasing up to $10 and falling up to $10"" in the short term.Deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies, including new announcements Tuesday by BP and BG Group, had suggested there would be tighter supplies in the future. The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production.

Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. “Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices,” said a press statement from the IMF mission. “While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises,” noted the IMF.

He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributor’s 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25.

The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world´s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

"LONDON: British bank HSBC Holdings Plc admitted on Sunday failings by its Swiss subsidiary, in response to media reports it helped wealthy customers dodge taxes and conceal millions of dollars of assets.""We acknowledge and are accountable for past compliance and control failures,"" HSBC said on Sunday after news outlets including French newspaper Le Monde and Britain’s The Guardian published allegations about its Swiss private bank. The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw “bricks” of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.

WTI then continued to fall further in late trade, dropping below $50.In London, Brent crude for April delivery was flat at $60.22 a barrel, one cent higher from a day earlier.US and Canadian output continued to rise despite the weak market, adding to the gap between the two key benchmarks.""Still-rising US production and climbing inventories remain the more relevant fundamental story,"" said Timothy Evans of Citi Futures.Analysts at JPMorgan said reports of production and export drops in the Middle East and North Africa helped hold up London prices.""An additional support also comes from higher crude demand in Europe from strong refinery margins and US refinery maintenance allowing refiners elsewhere to fill the product supply gap,"" they said.""We continue to expect that crude markets will come under pressure in the short term, however, fundamentals point to stress on Brent-related crude outweighing that on WTI.""More broadly, they said they foresee overall demand will decline as refineries adjust to different conditions, further pressing downward on prices.""Assuming that Brent markets witness a reversal of the supply losses that have tightened them significantly in recent weeks, then we would expect weaker Brent cash differentials and structure to erode the support for Brent crude against other benchmarks, notably WTI.""

The continuous large increases of crude inventories verify a possible slowdown of US oil demand,"" she added.Globally, crude supplies are being boosted after oil fields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the Hariga port after a pipeline was repaired, Bloomberg News reported.And Oman, the biggest Middle East producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.Crude prices lost around 60 percent of their value between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar that made oil expensive to purchase for holders of rival currencies.The euro continued to be pressured by the dollar Monday despite eurozone ministers tentatively agreeing to extend Greece´s bailout by four months.While oil prices have won support in recent weeks on a decline in operating US oil rigs and as energy giants cut investment, markets-watchers say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said a sustained rebound for oil prices was unlikely because of a global oversupply of the commodity, noting that US crude production has remained strong at above 9.2 million barrels per day.He said a strike in US oil refineries has led to an excess of crude in the American market as less of the product is being sent to the facilities for refining.Workers at three major US oil refineries operated with Royal Dutch Shell went on strike on Saturday in a dispute over safer working conditions, the United Steelworkers (USW) union said.About 1,350 employees in three refineries and chemical plants are affected by the latest strike action, which mirrored walkouts on other sites launched earlier this month.

The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the world’s third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.

"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest — and most influential — to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year — barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught — several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´""FBR is after those who can´t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent — but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme — tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender — was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

"LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. ""The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.""The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey.

Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

"London: New York oil prices sank to a six-year low on Monday, falling below $44 per barrel as the market was plagued by plentiful supplies and the strong dollar.In earlier deals, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for April delivery dived as low as $43.57 -- hitting the lowest since March 12, 2009.The contract later recovered slightly to stand at $44.40, down 44 cents from Friday´s closing level. European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April fell 79 cents to $53.38 a barrel in midday London trade.Crude futures had plunged by more than two dollars on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of US crude reserves reaching storage capacity with little sign of a slowdown in output despite a global glut. ""Selling pressure was generated on Friday by the IEA, which warned that storage capacities could soon be exhausted in the United States,"" said Commerzbank analysts.""The reason cited by the IEA was the massive oversupply, which stems first and foremost from the still rising US oil production.""The US Department of Energy last week said stockpiles in the world´s top crude consumer climbed to a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week. ""This week could be even more bearish for oil as there has been no shift in supply,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. Singapore-based Phillip Futures said ""with fundamentals remaining unchanged, we hardly find a reason for crude oil to break higher or even lower"". Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 per barrel between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the soaring dollar.Prices have since rebounded following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.""Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,"" the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations, said last week. McCarthy said oil prices are also under pressure owing to gains in the dollar against other major currencies ahead of a closely watched US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday. A stronger US dollar makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand. (AFP)

The euro changed hands at $1.0809 and 129.92 yen, down from $1.0871 and 130.54 yen in New York but still well above $1.0595 and 128.57 yen in Asia on Wednesday.While the US central bank opened the door for a rise from six years of zero percent rates, it lowered its forecasts for economic growth and inflation and stressed it would remain cautious before making any move.""It´s fair to say we now have somewhat stronger doubt that Fed rates ´lift-off´ will begin a early as June, than we did heading into the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee)"" meeting, National Australia Bank said.""The key takeaway is that (Fed chief Janet) Yellen has successfully established in the market´s mind the data, rather than date, dependency of Fed policy.""After a two-day meeting, the Fed on Wednesday issued a statement that removed a pledge to remain ""patient"" on raising interest rates, signalling a possible mid-year rate increase.However Yellen stressed growth prospects were more muted than three months ago, despite strong increases in jobs creation. She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. ""Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn´t mean we´re going to be impatient,"" Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed´s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen´s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank´s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.""The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,"" he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.

"KARACHI: Pakistan’s main stock index witnessed a bullish trend as it rebounded over 1,100 points during day trading on Tuesday, a day after the market plunged around 3.5 percent on fears of a selling spree by foreign investors.The benchmark Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100-index was hovering around 30,028.85 points at 1 pm, up 1,101.81 points or 3.81 percent from its previous close of 28,971.The previous day, the index tumbled 1,252 points to 28,706, a drop of 4.18 percent – one of the largest falls in a single day in recent years – before it recovered somewhat to end on 28,971, down 3.44 percent.The KSE has enjoyed startling growth in recent years even though Pakistan has been racked by militancy and political upheaval for more than a decade.But from the start of January to March 29, the market saw an outflow of foreign investment of $131 million compared with a $384 million inflow last year.There was speculation in the market that local buyers had overrun their capacity to absorb more offloaded shares from foreign investors, while rumours were also circulating that some stockbrokers were also on the verge of default. But investor confidence appeared to have returned as the bourse recovered today.  The government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been trying to boost Pakistan’s flagging economy since being elected in May 2013.Last week, Moody´s upgraded Pakistan´s dollar bond rating one notch from stable to positive on the back of improving macroeconomic indicators.

"NEW YORK: Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Iran’s nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group – the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany – hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member´s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.

"SINGAPORE: Oil futures climbed more than $1 a barrel on Monday, after Saudi Arabia raised prices for crude sales to Asia for a second month, signalling better demand in the region.International benchmark Brent regained ground after tumbling as much as 5 percent on Thursday, when a preliminary nuclear deal was finally reached between world powers and Iran. More Iranian oil could enter global markets if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.""While clearly a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number of obstacles,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.""Even if a final deal is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,"" the analysts said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21 higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working, although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai quotes, analysts said.""There is still competition for the Asia market even though it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete in the market right now,"" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.

Brent North Sea crude for May lost 46 cents to $57.66 in midday trade.The contracts had surged by three dollars each on Monday.""The current decline in oil prices is most likely due to profit-taking,"" Ken Hasegawa, energy trading manager at Newedge Group, told AFP. Analysts attributed the steep gains on Monday to investors concluding that the nuclear framework agreed between Iran and international powers will have a minimal near-term effect on global crude supplies.The deal Tehran agreed with the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany paves the way for the Islamic republic to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, including on oil investment.""Most traders were waiting on Iran nuclear talks to cause a flood in Iranian oil as sanctions get lifted,"" said Daniel Ang, investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore. ""However, the tone from the US seems firm and this means that sanctions would only be lifted slowly,"" he added.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the US-EU sanctions, which were put in place to prevent it building a nuclear bomb.

"Hong Kong: Asian markets rallied Wednesday, led by an almost four percent surge in Hong Kong on its first post-holiday trading day as it reacted to weak US jobs data that reduced the chances of a rate rise any time soon.The Japanese central bank´s decision to delay any new easing measures pushed the yen up against the dollar, while investors await the release of minutes from the Federal Reserve´s latest policy meeting.Oil prices ticked lower on profit-taking in Asia after climbing Tuesday to their highest level of 2015.Hong Kong, which last traded on Thursday, soared 3.80 percent, or 961.22 points, to 26,236.86.Shanghai ended 0.84 percent, or 33.43 points higher at 3,994.81 and Tokyo added 0.76 percent, or 149.27 points, to 19,789.81.Sydney rose 0.59 percent, or 34.7 points, to 5,960.7 and Seoul advanced 0.60 percent, or 12.23 points, to end at 2,059.26.Last week´s Labor Department data showing that the US economy created fewer jobs in March than it had for more than a year raised expectations that rates will be kept low through the summer.The next focal point is the release later Wednesday of minutes from the last Fed meeting, with dealers poring over them for clues about when the bank plans to announce a rise.In currency trading the dollar edged down after the Bank of Japan stood pat on monetary policy even though the country is struggling to overcome anaemic price growth.The dollar bought 119.88 yen, down from 120.32 yen in New York Tuesday but well above the low-119 yen range seen in Tokyo at the start of the week soon after the US jobs data.- Greece fears linger -""There´s still a little bit of doubt in the market as to really where the US economy is, and more importantly, how the Fed perceives the US economy,"" Raiko Shareef, a markets strategist in Wellington at Bank of New Zealand, told Bloomberg News. The dollar is ""in a little bit of a holding pattern"", he added.The euro rose to $1.0875 in Tokyo from $1.0813 in New York and to 130.32 yen from 130.11 yen.However, dealers were cautious as Greece faces a Thursday deadline for its next bailout repayment to the International Monetary Fund. Eurozone deputy finance ministers will meet on Wednesday and Thursday to seek agreement on Athens´s reforms needed to unlock the last tranche of its multibillion-dollar bailout and avert a default.On Wall Street Tuesday the Dow edged down 0.03 percent, the S&P 500 dropped 0.21 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.14 percent.Oil prices retreated from their 2015 highs, which were prompted by an easing of fears that Iranian crude would soon flood the market after last week´s nuclear deal with the West. Also providing support was news that Saudi Arabia had raised prices for Asia, citing increased demand.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery fell $1.10 to $52.88 a barrel in afternoon Asian trade and Brent crude for May dropped 71 cents to $58.39.On Tuesday WTI rose $1.84 and Brent was up 98 cents.Gold fetched $1,211.01 against $1,212.72 late Tuesday.In other markets:-- Taipei fell 0.73 percent, or 69.93 points, to 9,571.97.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. sank 2.05 percent to Tw$143.0 while Hon Hai eased 0.11 percent to Tw$93.7.-- Wellington was flat, edging up 4.28 points to 5,859.71.Spark New Zealand sank 2.77 percent to NZ$2.98 while Air New Zealand added 1.29 percent to NZ$2.75.-- Manila closed 0.77 percent lower, giving up 60.72 points to 8,037.96.Ayala Land was unchanged at 40 pesos while BDO Unibank Inc. dropped 1.17 percent to 118.50 pesos and Metro Pacific Investments fell 4.13 percent to 4.64 pesos.

"Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent, but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world´s number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors´ expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong´s market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong´s Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai´s exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE´s announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months.

"KARACHI: Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central bank’s efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed on Tuesday.Analyst said banks’ hefty invested into the government papers and low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9 billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of banks’ higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through the opening market operations.Tuesday’s data on monetary aggregates depicted that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230 trillion from a same period a year ago.The government’s rising demand for bank borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts’ view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, “Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.”Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the legal framework for creditors’ rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and impaired access to finance.

""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here.""

"BEIJING: Pakistan needs a “huge amount of financing” for infrastructure and energy projects and China is ready to announce help when President Xi Jinping visits next week, a foreign ministry official said Friday.Islamabad has for decades been Beijing´s closest ally in South Asia, and China -- which is expanding its influence in the region -- is a major trading partner and key supplier of military technology to Pakistan.Chinese assistant foreign minister Liu Jianchao declined to offer details in a briefing to reporters ahead of Xi´s two-day trip, which starts Monday, saying that the ""specific figure"" would be announced during the visit.But he said a ""huge amount of financing"" was needed for projects in the transport, infrastructure and energy fields that are part of a China-Pakistan economic corridor initiative.""China stands ready to provide financial support for Pakistan to be used on these projects,"" Liu said.The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi would announce a $46 billion spending plan for infrastructure, with the largest share going for electricity generation.Xi was originally scheduled to visit last September but Beijing cancelled the trip with Islamabad in the grip of major anti-government street protests.China has been a key financial and military ally of Islamabad over the years and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif secured promises of $42 billion worth of investment when he went to Beijing in November last year.Much of that centred on the energy sector -- Pakistan has wrestled with chronic power shortages in recent years that have scrubbed several points off GDP growth and inflicted misery on the everyday lives of its citizens.Pakistan´s foreign ministry said Thursday that a number of important agreements and memorandums of understanding would be signed during the visit, but gave no details.Liu said Xi´s visit would be the first by a Chinese president in nine years and stressed that it was his first overseas trip this year.""It is yet another major diplomatic action taken by China´s top leader in China´s neighbourhood,"" he said.He added that the trip will ""map out an overall plan for China-Pakistan relations and cooperation in various areas for the next five to 10 years and take bilateral relations to a new level.""

"Hong Kong: Asian markets followed a positive lead from Wall Street on Tuesday, with investors keeping an eye on Europe as Greece struggles to pay off its debts.Tokyo rose 0.79 percent, Hong Kong added 1.14 percent, Sydney gained 0.93 percent and Shanghai was up 0.72 percent, while Seoul was flat.The gains reversed some of the losses suffered on Monday that came on fears about Greece´s future in the eurozone as Athens looks to secure billions of euros in bailout cash to pay its enormous debts.With its creditors refusing to extend a repayment deadline while also haggling over its bailout reforms, the Greek government has ordered all public agencies to hand over their financial reserves.""With this act, the government hopes to cover urgent needs of the state amounting to three billion euros for the next 15 days,"" said a decree, which still needs adoption by the parliament.However, the euro held its ground in foreign exchange markets. The single currency bought $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of China´s economy comes with HSBC´s preliminary index of manufacturing activity on Thursday.US traders welcomed that move. The Dow jumped 1.17 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.92 percent and the Nasdaq rallied 1.27 percent.The dollar edged up despite a key Federal Reserve official suggesting a US rate hike could be put back.New York Fed President William C.

"New York: Oil prices traded mixed Monday after China slashed bank reserves requirements to get credit flowing more easily in the world´s largest energy consumer.West Texas Intermediate for May delivery climbed 64 cents to close at $56.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.In London, Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, was unchanged from Friday at $63.45 a barrel.China´s central bank announced Sunday it was cutting the reserve requirement ratio, the amount of cash that commercial banks must hold in reserve, by one percentage point, the second such move this year to boost lending. The move took effect Monday.""While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy than official comments previously indicated,"" said Brian Jackson, China economist at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action, prices retraced some gains after Saudi Arabia´s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast for US inventories.""It´s been choppy,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors, he said, are ""trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn"" in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape, showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.""There may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from the economies of the US, eurozone and China,"" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics.

"Hong Kong: Japanese shares hit a 15-year high Wednesday after the country recorded its first trade surplus in three years, while the euro weakened on growing concerns that Greece will not reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors.With few catalysts to spur business in Asia, other markets were mostly higher despite a broadly negative lead from Wall Street.Tokyo rallied 1.11 percent, Hong Kong gained 0.12 percent and Shanghai put on 0.26 percent while Seoul added 0.72 percent. Sydney slipped 0.58 percent.Tokyo´s Nikkei broke back through the 20,000 point barrier -- after briefly clearing the hurdle earlier this month -- as the yen slipped against the dollar.Before the market opened the finance ministry said March saw the country enjoy its first trade surplus since June 2012 thanks to tumbling oil prices and a boost in exports.However, economists warned the positive results might not last.""We expect the yen to weaken further in coming months, which should lift the cost of imports by more than the yen-value of exports,"" Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary.""The trade balance is unlikely to remain in surplus for long.""The dollar was at 119.68 yen against 119.63 yen in New York and well up from 119.44 yen in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar´s strength comes despite the diminishing likelihood of a US rate hike by the US Federal Reserve soon.""More and more the expectation is that the Fed won´t do anything soon. The momentum in equities is still there,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist at IG in Melbourne, told Bloomberg News.The euro slipped as investors nervously follow events in Europe as Greece struggles to scrape cash together to pay its bills.Athens is facing a backlash from the country´s mayors after it issued a decree ordering them to hand over their reserves in order to service its debts and pay wages.The government is locked in negotiations with its international creditors on unlocking some billions of euros in much-needed bailout funds. Failure to secure the cash will likely see it default and possibly crash out of the eurozone, which analysts fear could have global repercussions.Greece´s creditors sounded the alarm Saturday over the pace of debt negotiations, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi saying: ""More work, much more work is needed now, and it´s urgent.""The euro slipped to $1.0721 and 128.33 yen from $1.0735 and 128.42 yen in US trade.On Wall Street the Dow fell 0.47 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.15 percent but the Nasdaq added 0.39 percent.The next focus for investors is the release Thursday of HSBC´s preliminary report on activity in China´s manufacturing sector, which will give the latest indication about the state of the world´s number two economy.Oil prices were lower.

West Texas Intermediate for May delivery sank $1.12, or two percent, to close at $55.26 a barrel on its last day the contract´s trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, settled at $62.08 a barrel in London trade, down $1.37 (2.2 percent) from Monday´s closing level.News of the Saudi-led coalition wrapping up air strikes against rebels in Yemen, coming in afternoon trade in New York, accelerated losses on the market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group.""Oil is selling because the Saudis are going to end their operation in Yemen,"" Flynn said. ""This is why we´ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.""The end of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition saying the rebels´ threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed, eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday´s weekly inventories report from the US Department of Energy were bearish. The country´s historically high crude inventories were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve. News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.""There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note Tuesday.

"MILAN: Milan’s Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italy’s deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since Shanghai´s groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city´s renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milan´s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the country´s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with Italy´s unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to Italy´s strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movement´s march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of Friday´s demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expo´s critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.

"London: Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday as the market seeks to build on strong gains in April following massive falls earlier in the year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in June won 56 cents to $59.49 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for June won 47 cents to stand at $66.93 a barrel in London midday deals.After slumping at the start of the year, oil prices rose by about a fifth in value during April owing to several factors including concerns about unrest in Yemen, the weakening dollar and fewer US rigs in operation, analysts said.However, prices remain well down after plunging almost 60 percent between June and the start of 2015 on the back of a global supply glut and ramped up production.""Crude oil producers in the US have significantly cut back output in an attempt to address the significant supply overhang which has exerted downward pressure on... prices since June last year,"" Kash Kamal, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers said on Tuesday.The International Monetary Fund has said that Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.""Saudi Arabia seem committed to defending their market share and have even increased output to over 10 million barrels per day in April,"" said Kamal.""Support for higher crude prices has partly come from a weaker dollar,"" he added.A weaker dollar makes oil priced in the US unit cheaper for holders of others currencies, boosting demand.

"DUBAI: Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They would be better off to ""adjust gradually"" using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.

"KARACHI: Standard and Poor's on Tuesday revised Pakistan's credit rating outlook from stable to positive and forecast higher GDP growth for 2015 to 2017, amid a stint of economic reforms.In a statement, the agency said the country had made significant progress in stablising its economic, fiscal and external performance, alongside eased financing conditions.“We are therefore revising the outlook on the long term ratings on Pakistan to positive from stable,” the agency said, affirming a B- rating.S&P also revised its earlier average growth estimates for 2015 to 2017 to 4.6 percent from 3.8 percent.This reflected “strong capital inflows and remittances, and lower oil prices, which support business confidence and investment spending,” it said.Pakistan’s GDP grew by 4.1 percent in the fiscal year ending June last year.Net foreign exchange reserves with the central bank reached $12.36 billion dollars in recent weeks from just $3.2 billion in January 2014.The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has voiced satisfaction with Pakistan’s progress on reforms required under a $6.6-billion bailout agreed in 2013.The loan came on condition that Pakistan – which was suffering an energy crisis – would carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.In March, Moody’s upgraded Pakistan’s dollar bonds rating one notch from stable to positive.Pakistan has been trying to boost its flagging economy since Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was elected nearly two years ago.

The group, led by de-facto kingpin Saudi Arabia, pumps about 30 percent of global crude.Nicholas Teo, analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, added that concerns over a persistent global oversupply ""continue to put a cap on oil prices"". Those worries were compounded by the latest US data showing petroleum drilling is picking up in some areas. The closely watched Baker Hughes US oil rig count fell by just 11 to 668 last week.Dealers have been hoping that a slowdown in US shale output could help ease the build up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January.

"WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama Thursday called US oil production an “important” source of energy as America transitions towards cleaner resources, defending his move to allow petroleum giant Shell to drill in the Alaskan Arctic.Obama´s administration gave the petroleum giant a green light three days ago to explore the Chukchi Sea near Alaska -- as long as the Anglo-Dutch firm has the correct permits from the agencies that regulate the environment and marine mammal health.Environmental groups oppose the drilling due to the vulnerability of Arctic animals that are already struggling with melting sea ice and the risk that an oil spill would pose to the region.""Despite the fact that Shell had put in an application for exploration in this region several years ago, we delayed it for a very lengthy period of time, until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances that we have not seen before,"" Obama said during a Thursday press conference.Shell put its drilling plans for the Alaska Arctic on hold in 2013 following multiple embarrassing problems with its two rigs.One, the Kulluk, washed ashore after breaking loose from towing vessels in stormy seas in southern Alaska in January.Another, the Noble Discoverer, was recently cited by the US Coast Guard for numerous safety and operational deficiencies.Both rigs were sent to Asia for repair and maintenance work.""Shell had to go back to the drawing board, revamp its approach,"" Obama said.""I am working internationally to reduce our carbon emissions and to replace, over time, fossil fuels with clean energies,"" he added.""In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil fuels, and when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil and natural gas is important,"" Obama said.He added that importing oil and gas meant it might be ""purchased from places that have much lower environmental standards than we do.""Some Americans grew increasingly wary of drilling after the April 2010 explosion of BP-leased Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean.A Shell spokesman said that operations in the Chukchi Sea are scheduled to begin in the coming months.

Li will head for Rio on Tuesday evening to see some of China´s investment in the city, which Brasilia supplanted as the capital in 1960 but which will in August next year welcome South America´s first ever Olympic Games.On Thursday, Li will continue a Latin American swing designed to increase Chinese influence in the region, heading to Colombia before visiting Peru and Chile.Chinese investment in Brazil has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole rose some 2,550 percent between 2000 and 2012 from barely $10 billion to $255.5 billion.Boom in Sino-Brazilian tradeSino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, said ahead of Li´s arrival that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is under way. The first involved trade in raw materials and the focus now is on heavy industry and infrastructure, he said.Graca Lima said Friday that Rousseff and Li will ink a series of accords on political and commercial issues, and some 30 investment deals. One mooted project is a proposed rail link stretching some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) from the key Brazilian port of Santos to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.Graca Lima said the plan would take some three to four years to realize, but he assured it is ""advancing,"" despite some environmental groups voicing concern.The countries are also expected to announce the delivery of 22 jetliners from Brazil´s Embraer to China -- part of a larger order of 60 airplanes from the world´s number three commercial aircraft developer.Brazil has seen its reputation hit by a huge graft scandal at oil giant Petrobras. But the firm received a boost earlier this year when it signed a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.""China is fulfilling a desperately-needed role of investor in Latin America and the Caribbean -- Brazil desperately needs investment,"" says Charles Tang, chairman of the Rio-based Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry.""The US back yard is growing a Chinese back garden - not just in Brazil but all over Latin America.""""We believe in the fundamentals of Brazil,"" Tang told AFP.""China sees opportunities in Brazil for investment and also has the funds available to invest"" for strategic and geopolitical reasons.In an interview, Tang referred to a World Policy Institute essay he penned in 2013 in which he said ""Latin America and China´s economies are complementary. Brazil ... has insufficient savings to finance increases in export production and job creation or build the infrastructure it needs.""China has abundant capital -- but needs the plentiful strategic resources that Brazil has.""Li´s visit will feature trade delegations some 130-strong from both countries during his Brasilia stay. In Rio, he will attend the unveiling of Chinese-made trains for a new Metro line.

"London: Oil prices fell on Tuesday as a global supply glut and soft demand overshadowed the impact of geopolitical tensions in the crude-rich Middle East, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in June slid 43 cents to $59 a barrel.Brent North Sea crude for July shed 63 cents to stand at $65.64 a barrel in London afternoon deals.""According to official data... Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,"" said analysts at Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said ""global oversupply with weak demand"" continues to put a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already ""used to"" unrest in the region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez Canal.""Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,"" Commerzbank analysts added. ""In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.""Oil supplies from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers, which have higher costs, out of the market.

"ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan– APP/Geo News

"BRASILIA: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South America’s largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of Li´s first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Li´s host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the country´s tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South America´s first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Li´s first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for Brazil´s state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a ""new intensity in our relations.""""China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,"" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to China´s ""rich experience"" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing ""would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.""Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazil´s flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazil´s number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.Li´s tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to China´s Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazil´s Vale, the world´s biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Li´s arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that ""a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,"" Rousseff told reporters.

"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran´s nuclear programme.  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP)

"KUWAIT CITY: Foreigners working in the energy-rich Arab states of the Gulf sent more than $100 billion in remittances to their home countries last year, an economic report showed Tuesday.The figure was twice as high as remittances in 2010, an indication of strong growth, the head of economic research at Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz), Raghu Mandagoathur, said in the report.Around 25 million expats live in the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- equal to the native population.The remittances are estimated at 6.2 percent of the combined GDP of the six GCC states of $1.6 trillion, the report said, citing IMF and World Bank figures.In comparison, foreigners in the United States and Britain sent home just 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP, respectively, it said.Saudi Arabia topped the list with its estimated 10 million expats sending home $44 billion, followed by UAE with 29 billion.Remittances from Kuwait and Qatar were $12 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, while smaller transfers were made out of Oman and Bahrain, the report said.The majority of Gulf expatriates originate from India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen.The report attributed the high level of remittances to curbs applied by GCC states on foreign ownership and investment.And unlike in Western countries, foreigners have no hope of acquiring citizenship in GCC states regardless of the duration of residence.The report advised GCC states to encourage expatriates to invest by launching specialised services and opening up their markets to foreign residents, especially the real estate sector.

"ISLAMABAD: Moody's Investor Service has upgraded Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating by a notch, from Caa1 to B3, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar announced on Thursday in the National Assembly.According to Dar, Moody's had downgraded the country’s credit rating to Caa1 on July 13, 2012.The outlook for the rating back then was negative. A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moody’s said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund.

Official sources on Tuesday said Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) conducts nationwide broadband Quality of Service (QoS) survey in metropolitan cities and performance of different packages offered by operators was measured in different times.  During the survey three months data of non technical parameters i.e. response time of assistance service billing and service provisioning complaint resolution time were also analysed. The survey results analysis revealed that by and large QoS performance of broadband service providers can be rated as good.

"SHANGHAI: China's tumbling stock market showed signs of seizing up on Wednesday, as companies scrambled to escape the rout by having their shares suspended and indexes plunged after the securities regulator warned of ""panic sentiment"" gripping investors.Beijing, which has struggled for more than a week to bend the market to its will, unveiled yet another battery of measures to arrest the sell-off, and the People's Bank of China said it would step up support to brokerages enlisted to prop up shares.The CSI300 index of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen closed down 6.8 percent, while the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 5.9 percent.With nearly half the market on a trading halt and another round of margin calls forcing leveraged investors to dump whatever shares could find a buyer, blue chips that had been supported by stabilisation funds earlier in the week bore the brunt.""I've never seen this kind of slump before. I don't think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,"" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities.""Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.""More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece.""Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note. ""We expect slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis.""Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world's second largest economy, with copper prices falling to a six-year low, Shanghai nickel futures sliding by their 5 percent daily limit, and oil falling towards $56 a barrel, near a three month-low.TRADING HALTSMore than 500 China-listed firms announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking total suspensions to about 1,300 - 45 percent of the market or roughly $2.4 trillion worth of stock - as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage.With so many small-cap companies sheltering on the sidelines, the ChiNext growth board, which has seen some of the biggest swings in valuations, fell a modest 0.8 percent.The plunge in China's previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China's top leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.Beijing's interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars' worth of stocks, helped by a state-backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided 260 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) to 21 brokerages, though that sum is only 40 percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since June 18.RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets, which are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around 85 percent of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.""It's uncommon to see so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls, and the index futures swinging so wildly,"" said Wang Feng, CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.""It's a stampede. And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.""A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other ""stability measures"" have done little to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there had been a big increase in ""irrational selling"" of stocks.Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.""Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in their share prices,"" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie.

The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.""Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,"" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF´s chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.""The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lion´s share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,"" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the world´s largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. Canada´s forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and Mexico´s by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economy´s soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness ""now that the fog has largely cleared.""""Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,"" he said.Greece´s debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).""Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,"" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed ""broadly on track"".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. ""Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,"" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.""The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,"" Blanchard said.""There is no particular reason to have lost confidence"" in China´s economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the world´s number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin America´s largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.""The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,"" it said.

"NEW YORK: The euro gained ground on Wednesday on hopes that Greece´s debt crisis will be resolved in a few days, averting a default to its European Union creditors.The euro, which had fallen to a five-week low of $1.0916 on Tuesday, rebounded as Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras vowed to present ""credible"" reform plans to creditors by Thursday.The 19-nation currency rose to $1.1074 around 2100 GMT from $1.1007 at the same time Tuesday.European Union President Donald Tusk has set the ""final deadline"" for a deal on Sunday at a summit of all 28 EU leaders.""Between the unusual suspension of trading on the NYSE and the meltdown in Asian equities, investors sent the euro higher on signs of progress towards a deal for Greece,"" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management.The New York Stock Exchange halted trading Wednesday for more than three hours due to technical problems that it said were not caused by hacking.Meanwhile, a weeks-long rout in Chinese equities continued, with stocks losing more than 30 percent since mid-June.The Federal Reserve´s release of the minutes of the June 16-17 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee showed policymakers favored caution about embarking on the first interest rate hike in nine years.Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, said the Fed minutes were less important to markets than normal because of the heightened level of concern regarding Greece and China.""On both fronts, underlying conditions have deteriorated markedly since the Fed´s mid-June meeting, so the minutes may be largely irrelevant at this point,"" he said.

"London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing. (AFP)

"LONDON: Oil prices rose Tuesday as markets weighed the effects of Iran´s deal with six world powers on curbing the Islamic republic´s suspected ambitions for a nuclear bomb.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery gained 84 cents at $53.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European benchmark Brent oil for August delivery added 66 cents at $58.51 a barrel in London. ""I think people had already sold down the price of oil, expecting an agreement,"" said Michael Lynch, an analyst with the US-based consultancy Strategic Energy & Economic Research. ""So it´s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.""""Now that it´s actually happened, people are buying back in,"" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran´s oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.""To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran´s stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Iran´s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran´s nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC´s fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.""Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,"" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.""Iran´s oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,"" it noted.The ratings agency added: ""We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.""The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.""A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is ""interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran´s energy potential"".BP added in a statement: ""We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities once able to do so.""Lid on pricesLooking ahead, ""the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market"", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.""We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,"" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase.Iran´s OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq ""have both significantly ramped up production this year"", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.""There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,"" he told AFP.

"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector, in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.“The first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15,” the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued, the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit, and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last year’s level, could not match the outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from a robust growth in workers’ remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBP’s liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year ago, enough to finance three months of the country’s import bill.The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decade’s low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing sectors (agriculture and industry), services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year.

The fresh volatility comes after Beijing launched a series of initiatives to staunch a bloodletting that saw a 30 percent plunge in Shanghai and trillions wiped off valuations.Among the measures were a police crackdown on short-selling and a ban on big shareholders and company executives from selling stock for six months, adding to earlier announcements.Meanwhile, dealers said a drop in commodities prices raised concerns about the global economy as crude oil briefly fell below $50 a barrel on Tuesday, and gold traded near a five-year low.""This commodities rout is a very big concern,"" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg News. ""There´s risk for a further downside. It looks like the overall global growth outlook is continuing to slow.""Investors were also keeping an eye on Greece where the government hiked taxes and paid billions of euros to its creditors on Monday, as banks reopened just days after the debt-laden country reached a bailout deal with its creditors.In currency markets, the dollar was trading around a five-week high at 124.34 yen, against 124.30 yen in New York on Monday.The euro bought $1.0825 and 134.61 yen, little changed from $1.0824 and 134.55 yen in US trading.""The weaker yen and cheaper oil will have a positive effect on Japanese stocks,"" said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.Eyes are now on Washington as the Federal Reserve considers when to hike interest rates from their record lows as the US economy gets back up to speed. Last week Fed chief Janet Yellen said she saw a rise taking place before 2016 -- a rate hike is a plus for the dollar.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on bonds and other assets to support their respective economies, pushing down the value of the yen and euro.On oil markets, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was down 10 cents to $50.05, after briefly dipping to $49.94, and Brent crude for September fell eight cents to $56.57 a barrel in morning Asian trade.Gold fetched $1,103.54 after falling as low as $1,072 per ounce in Asia trade Monday.

"New York: Crude oil prices slipped lower on Monday as a UN Security Council vote highlighted the prospect of Iranian oil returning to the global market.West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August, the US benchmark, fell for the fourth straight session, dropping 74 cents to $50.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.London, global benchmark Brent North Sea crude for September delivery closed at $56.65 a barrel, down 45 cents from Friday´s settlement.For the WTI contract, Monday´s closing level was the lowest since March 17, when it settled at $43.46. Several times during the session it dipped below $50, flirting with its lowest close since April 2.""The market is in search of a bottom,"" said Gene McGillian of Tradition Energy.According to the analyst, ""with the dollar rising the market is still trying to price in the idea we could have additional supplies to oil come to the market"" in the near future, following the expected lifting of economic sanctions against Iran.Earlier in the day the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution endorsing the historic deal reached last week between six major powers and Iran on Tehran´s nuclear program.Citi Futures analyst Tim Evans said that oil was swept up Monday in a wider decline in commodity prices, pointing out gold dropped to new five-year lows.""We continue to view the current physical surplus as sufficient to drive price lower, but more Iranian production will certainly add to the overhang and push an eventual rebalancing of market further down the road,"" Evans said.The Islamic Republic´s exports could reach a potential 2.4 million barrels per day in 2016, from 1.6 million barrels in 2014, according to data from economist Charles Robertson at investment bank Renaissance Capital.

"LONDON: Gold fell back towards five-year lows on Wednesday as investors continued to pull away from the precious metal, with a slide through key chart levels earlier this week setting prices up for further losses.A looming rise in US interest rates, the first in nearly a decade, has dented gold's investment appeal, encouraging more sellers in the market after Monday's 3 percent rout, its biggest one-day drop since September 2013.Holdings in top gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining another 4.8 tonnes to hit their lowest since 2008. Its reserves have nearly halved from their 2012 peak.Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,095.69 an ounce at 0940 GMT, while US gold futures for August delivery were down $8.70 an ounce at $1,094.80. On Monday, gold slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1,088.05 an ounce.It failed to benefit from a softer tone to the dollar and stock markets on Wednesday, which usually would be expected to give some respite to the metal.""We expect further losses in gold,"" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. ""Gold prices are falling against the weaker dollar, declining equity markets -- those are clearly bad signs. Everything speaks against rising gold prices.""ETF investors are getting rid of their holdings, and it seems speculators are also continuing to sell. It's a perfect storm for gold,"" he said. ""Expectations about the developments of US interest rates are clearly an underlying trend.""Monday's selloff came on the back of huge volumes traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange after investors dumped more than $500 million of bullion in New York in four seconds during early Asian trading hours.That sparked a slide through key chart levels, triggering stop-loss orders that added to momentum. From a technical perspective, gold remains under pressure.""Our next price target is seen at $1,044, the 2010 low, followed by $1,006, the late 2009 high,"" technical analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note. ""Lower lows and lower highs keep this bearish price move in motion. Only a close back above $1,133 will stabilize the metal.""Physical demand has been sluggish despite this week's steep price drop. India is not rushing to pick up slack Chinese demand as would-be buyers wait for further price drops, with a wedding season lull and poor rains curbing appetite.Spot platinum was down 0.9 percent at $968.95 an ounce, while palladium was down 1.1 percent at $618.90, both trading near multi-year lows. Silver was down 0.3 percent at $14.77 an ounce.

"New York: The dollar weakened Tuesday after huge gains the prior week appeared to encourage profit taking, while the euro benefited from Greece´s progress toward a bailout.""A lull in the US economic calendar over the first half of the week has enticed many to cash in a few of the dollar´s big two percent gains from last week which amounted to its best weekly performance in two months,"" said Joe Manimbo at Western Union Business Solutions.The euro rose to $1.0942 around 2100 GMT from $1.0824 at the same time Monday.

"Singapore: Oil prices were mixed in Asia Thursday, with WTI stuck below $50 a barrel after a rise in US stockpiles added to concerns over a supply glut, analysts said.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said the country´s commercial crude stockpiles rose 2.5 million barrels last week, while supplies at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma, hub were up 800,000 barrels.The report also showed US production staying at near-record levels of about 9.6 million barrels per day, bad news for a market already awash with crude from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).In late-morning Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in September was up six cents at $49.25 after closing Wednesday below $50 a barrel for the first time since April.Brent crude for September fell six cents to $56.12.""US inventories expanded more than expected... which exacerbated the oversupply problem, especially when Saudi is pumping at record production levels,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore.""OPEC produced 32.1 million barrels per day in June, with the largest increase coming from Iraq and Saudi Arabia. This was 2.1 million more than what the organisation said it will maintain,"" Aw said in a market commentary.A strong US currency is also putting further downward pressure on oil. With the commodity priced in dollars, it becomes more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, denting demand.""The recent run-up in the greenback presented another pressure point for crude. It now looks like oil may move lower, with March lows of $42-$45 in the crosshairs,"" Aw said.Expectations that the US central bank is on track to raise interest rates this year have boosted the dollar as investors flock to the currency in the hope of getting better returns.

"SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell on Monday after closing the previous session at their lowest levels since March on renewed oversupply concerns from the United States and Iraq, although a weaker dollar helped to limit deeper losses.Investors are looking to the US Federal Reserve for direction this week. The central bank starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday that could result in a September interest rate hike that would strengthen the greenback.""The markets are looking for price guidance from Janet & Co,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress, referring to Fed Chair Janet Yellen and the bank.""There is scope for the dollar bulls to be disappointed this week (which) might be a driver for oil prices and the commodities complex overall,"" Le Brun said.A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities, including oil, cheaper for consumers using other currencies.Brent crude for September was down 2 cents at $54.60 a barrel as of 0655 GMT after dropping 65 cents in the previous session to $54.62, its lowest close since March 19.US crude for September was down 12 cents at $48.02, after falling 31 cents in the previous session to $48.14, its lowest settlement since March 31. It hit an intra-day low of $47.72 on Friday, the lowest intraday price since April 1.Sparking new worries about a global glut, US oil producers added 21 drilling rigs last week, the biggest rise since April 2014, according to Baker Hughes.The increase in drilling activity came despite a 21 percent collapse in US crude prices from about $61 a barrel in mid-June. A 20 percent downturn is considered by many traders to constitute a bear market.In Iraq, exports from its southern oilfields are on course for a monthly record, having topped 3 million barrels per day so far this month, according to loading data and an industry source.The expectation of continued abundant oil supplies, including an output increase from Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led the National Australia Bank on Monday to revise its oil price forecasts in a monthly report.""We now expect oil prices to stay below $70 a barrel for the rest of 2015 and 2016,"" the bank said.Speculators cut long bets on US crude futures and options to the lowest level in five years last week, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

"KARACHI: Pakistan on Tuesday received some $336 million from the United States for its ongoing role in combating a Taliban insurgency in neighbouring Afghanistan.The injection of cash, which comes as the Taliban steps up its annual summer offensive launched in late April, has helped Pakistan´s foreign exchange reserves reach a fresh high of about $19 billion, state bank officials said.Regular payments to Pakistan under the Coalition Support Fund (CSF) programme began in 2001 when Pakistan joined the US-led coalition in Afghanistan as a ""frontline ally"".Pakistan provides use of its air bases and other facilities in exchange for the reimbursements.The central State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in a one-line press note said it had received a total of $336.8 million under the CSF programme, which is the first tranche of a $1.5 billion for the current fiscal year ending June 2016.Pakistan has received a total of $13 billion in CSF payments since the programme began.US-led NATO forces ended their combat mission in Afghanistan in December, leaving local forces to battle militants alone, but a 13,000-strong residual force remains for training and counter-terrorism operations.The Afghan government meanwhile conducted its first face-to-face talks with Taliban cadres on July 7 in a Pakistani hill station, aimed at ending the 14-year insurgency.But despite the willingness to engage in talks there has been no let-up in militant attacks, which are taking a heavy toll on civilians.Almost 1,000 civilians were killed in the conflict during the first four months of this year, a sharp jump from the same period last year, according to the United Nations.

"Hong Kong: Asian markets tumbled further Tuesday, dragged down by another massive sell-off in Shanghai a day after the mainland Chinese market´s heaviest one-day losses in more than eight years.Fears of a resumption of the rout that strafed Chinese shares over a month until July 8 sent global traders running Monday, with Wall Street falling for a fifth day in a row and safe-haven gold edging back up after a recent slip.The dollar weakened against the yen on risk-aversion while analysts said the latest crisis on Chinese markets could affect Federal Reserve policymakers´ decision when considering hiking interest rates.Shanghai, which collapsed 8.48 percent Monday, fell a further four percent Tuesday, while Hong Kong was 0.50 percent down. Tokyo shed 1.07 percent, Sydney was 0.89 percent lower and Seoul retreated 0.83 percent.Chinese investors rushed for the exit Monday as more data showing the economy still struggling mixed with fears that government measures to prevent a market crash -- including providing vast sums of cash to support shares -- will not last.The moves -- introduced after a more than 30 percent dive that wiped trillions off valuations in just under four weeks -- had been credited with helping to stem the bleeding, stabilise trading and put prices back on an upward trajectory. The market had surged more than 150 percent in the year to hitting a near-term peak on June 12.Tuesday´s losses came despite assurances from Beijing that it will unleash more cash to provide stability to jittery share markets.State-backed China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which has reportedly already pumped billions of yuan into mainland equities under a government plan, will continue to buy stocks, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. - Return of volatility -""The worst time has passed but we think there is a final leg for this correction,"" Steve Yang, strategist at UBS Group AG, said.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's car market has been dominated by Japanese automakers for decades, but a mini-economic revival looks set to attract new players from Europe and Korea into the mix.Despite heavy taxation on imported vehicles, enthusiasm for owning a car in Pakistan has remained undented – thanks in part to underdeveloped public transport in the country´s sprawling cities, but also the social status it brings.Toyota, Suzuki and Honda car assembly plants already work around the clock in the southern port city of Karachi and eastern Lahore – yet customers can still wait for up to four months for new vehicles to be delivered.Now demand for cars in the South Asian giant of 200 million people is accelerating even more quickly, as economic growth has reached its fastest pace since 2008 while renewed investor confidence and easing inflation have spurred consumer spending.Keen to cash in, a delegation from German auto giant Volkswagen visited the country in recent weeks, according to Pakistani officials and German diplomats.Company spokesman Christoph Adomat told AFP that while ""Volkswagen is constantly evaluating market opportunities on a worldwide basis... there are no decisions for an investment from Volkswagen side in Pakistan"".Miftah Ismail, the chairman of Pakistan Board of Investment who took part in the talks, said Volkswagen was not the only company expressing an interest. ""There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants in Pakistan,"" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European cars dominated Pakistan´s roads in the early years after it gained independence from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the 1990s, while South Korea´s Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried – and failed – to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900 in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan´s roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan´s booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachi´s share market among the world´s top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.""Pakistani automakers haven´t really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,"" Khan told AFP.""But given VW´s impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.""

"MANILA: Gold hovered near a 5-1/2-year low on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened after comments from a Federal Reserve official backed expectations that the U.S. central bank would hike interest rates as early as next month.Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart has said it would take ""significant deterioration"" in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September, according to the Wall Street Journal.Gold, an asset that does not earn interest, has taken a hit given rising risks of a US rate hike. The Fed looks intent on lifting rates this year for the first time since 2006 as the U.S. economy strengthens, particularly its labour market.Spot gold was flat at $1,086.90 an ounce by 0606 GMT.

It puts us in a unique position among global news providers,"" said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of the New York Times Company.""We believe that no other news organisation has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or comparable digital subscription revenue. It´s a tribute to the hard work and innovation of our marketing, product and technology teams and the continued excellence of our journalism.""The Times began its online paywall strategy in 2011 and has been emphasising digital as print circulation and advertising decline.In 2012, the company said it took in more revenue from circulation than advertising for the first time.Thompson said international customers represent about 13 percent of the digital subscribers, noting that it was ""a percentage we expect will continue to grow very nicely in the coming quarters.""Digital traffic was up 27 percent year-over-year, to an average of 60 million monthly users, which helps boost ad revenues, according to Thomson.Ken Doctor, a media analyst at Outsell, said the milestone for the newspaper is ""worth celebrating for all who value journalism.""But Doctor said the newspaper cannot rest on its laurels.""The next generation of Times execs faces this question: What do we build on top of the paywall?"" he said in a blog post.This model ""can only take the Times so far; it needs to find additional spigots of reader revenue to get past flat revenue and into growth.""- Quarterly numbers -The Times said separately that its profit for the second quarter jumped 79 percent from a year ago to $16.4 million.The rise in profit came amid lower costs, while revenues dipped 1.5 percent from a year earlier, to $382 million.Circulation revenues grew, but failed to make up for the drop in advertising revenues.Second-quarter print advertising revenue fell 12.8 percent while digital ad sales grew 14.2 percent. Digital advertising pulled in $48.3 million, or 32.5 percent, of total ad revenues for the quarter ending June 30.Digital ad growth ""was again driven by growth in mobile, paid posts and video,"" Thompson said.""Expense management will remain a top priority as we head into the second half of 2015, although our emphasis on digital investment and execution is also more intense than ever.""Thompson said he expects to boost readership through partnerships recently announced with Facebook and Starbucks.

"KARACHI: Desperate to widen the tax base in a country where less then one percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded 422 vehicles.

"Shanghai: China´s central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the world´s second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan -- also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the country´s exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in the US.The People´s Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen the yuan´s two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range is calculated from a central ""reference rate"" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC´s move means it will now also take into account the previous day´s close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency´s value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before Tuesday´s announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.

"KARACHI: In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015. Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. “In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return,” he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. “It will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time,” he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBR’s new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers’ data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.

Brent crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brent´s September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling prices.""The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to pressure oil prices,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of an imminent US rate rise, after China´s shock devaluation of the yuan last week hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.""The devaluation of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.""This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.""Gupta said traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for further clues on the health of the world´s second-largest economy.Traders will also comb through the minutes of the US central bank´s meeting in late July, due for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.""We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few months,"" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.

"WASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and ""shareable"" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for ""strategic partnerships"" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the ""social news"" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.""It´s a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,"" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed´s founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.""BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,"" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.""They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.""The investment follows Monday´s announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat ""shareable"" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by France´s Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeed´s finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed ""has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.""BuzzFeed ""is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,"" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often don´t read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in ""native"" advertising, which includes ""sponsored"" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed´s executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean ""collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.""Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of ""unicorns,"" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU.

"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the world´s top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the world´s biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world´s top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.

"LONDON: Global oil prices hit a new six and a half year low Thursday, nearing the key $40 a barrel level as a surprise rise in US stocks fuelled supply glut fears.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery sank to $40.21 per barrel, the lowest level since March 2009. It later stood at $40.30, down 50 cents from Wednesday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for October delivery meanwhile slid to $46.31 a barrel, a point last seen in mid-January and not far off a six-year nadir. The contract later stood at $46.40, down 76 cents.""US stockpiles unexpectedly expanded when the market was looking at a contraction, which heightened the global oversupply concerns,"" said Bernard Aw, a market strategist at IG Markets.""This added pressure to crude prices, and we see WTI drop below $41, heading towards the key $40 level. We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions remain unfavourable to oil.""The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32 a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured by excess supplies.""Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015 begging the question how low can oil go,"" it said in a market commentary, adding that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel ""is a conceivable reality.""But Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in Thursday´s trading session.""Technically, we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below $40 is going to be an arduous task,"" he said.""We see $40 for WTI to be a strong psychological support.""

"KARACHI: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has initiated a drive to identify income sources of luxurious vehicles’ owners to ensure their tax return filings, confiscating vehicles on non-compliance, official sources said on Thursday.The sources said tax officials are obtaining data of registered motor vehicles above 1,000cc to determine the sources of income of their owners to increase filings of tax returns.They told The News that Inland Revenue asked local car assemblers and customs authorities to share the last five-year data of purchased vehicles with the tax department.“We are comparing this with the data provided by the provincial motor vehicle registration authorities,” said a source.The sources said the FBR has started issuing notices to the owners of vehicles and around 422 vehicles have been seized on non-compliance.Motor vehicle registration authorities of various cities have so far shared data of 821,000 registered vehicles above 1,000 CC, while Indus Motors Co Limited, Pak Suzuki Motors Co Ltd and Honda Atlas Motors Ltd have provided the details of 73,200, 153,700 and 45,000 vehicles, respectively.The sources said the customs department will also provide the details of vehicles imported during the past five years, including those cleared under the amnesty scheme announced in 2013.They said a number of smuggled vehicles are being used, especially in rural areas.An official at Regional Tax Office (RTO) Karachi said vehicles were also cleared on fake identity for which customs authorities are responsible.The customs cleared around 51,200 vehicles under the amnesty scheme 2013 and earned the FBR Rs16.2 billion as duty and taxes.“The amnesty was granted on clearance and a vehicle owner is required to file income tax returns and declare source of income,” said the source.However, the FBR failed to identify the real ownership due to apathy of customs department fraught with corruption and misconduct.The Federal Tax Ombudsman, in 2014, released a detailed report on irregularities in clearance of imported vehicles.“Granting amnesty to smuggling is counterproductive as it promotes smuggling, emboldens smugglers and contributes to black economy,” the report said.It further said luxury vehicles were mostly smuggled to cater to the upper class, adding that therefore the amnesty was more undesirable and against the national interest.“Apart from the conceptual irrational and counter-productivity of amnesty for smuggled vehicles, the amnesty scheme 2013 was allegedly misused for corrupt motives by the customs staff for regularising such vehicles as had either not yet arrived in the country or these were not physically presented or actually seized by the customs,” the report said.Besides, many tampered and stolen vehicles might have been granted amnesty due to weak or non-checking of tampering and absence of any filer for stolen vehicles, it said.“It will be difficult to cross-match the data of imported vehicles with those registered with the provincial authorities in such as scenario,” said a source in the Inland Revenue.

"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday warned exchange companies on ‘artificial shortage’ of the US currency that dropped rupee further to 104 against dollar amid a frenzy in the currency market.“The artificial shortage of the US currency is a major source of concern,” Abid Qamar, the chief spokesperson of SBP told The News. “The State Bank is strictly monitoring the exchange rate movement in the open market and instructed the exchange companies’ heads that they should take necessary actions.”Qamar said the central bank expressed its concerns over the falling rupee value in the open market despite that the bank has allowed exchange companies to import dollars to meet the growing demand for the greenback.“(The central bank) has warned the exchange companies to make all-out efforts for curbing the US currency shortage in the market,” he added.Qamar said recent move in the kerb dollar rate is really a source of worry for the central bank. “The rising supply-demand gap is a source of worry.”The rupee hit 104 against the US currency on Friday at the open market as dollar shortages continued. It was quoted 103.50/103.70 against the greenback.The rupee also breached its support level of 101 and closed at 102.02 versus dollar in the interbank market.The rupee has depreciated 3.5 percent since August 2014. The [interest] spread on buying and selling of the dollar between interbank and open markets has widened to Rs2. The State Bank has clearly instructed that the spread should not exceed 25 paisas.Malik Bostan, President Forex Association of Pakistan said the open currency market was volatile due to rise in dollar demand from Hajj pilgrims and imposition of 0.3 percent withholding tax on banking transactions for non-filers, who are now trading in dollar to avoid the tax.Hajj flights started from August 17 and will end next month. Therefore, Bostan said people have started buying dollar and Saudi Riyal for their journey.Meanwhile, the head of the central bank’s foreign exchange department, in a meeting with the representatives of exchange companies, directed them to bring stability in the kerb market by ensuring smooth supply of the foreign currencies.Bostan said the SBP ordered the exchange companies, during the meeting, to use biometric verification system in foreign exchange dealings for due diligence of the customer.“The SBP said it would provide foreign exchange to the exchange companies to curb the shortage,” Bostan claimed.“It was also suggested that companies would not sell or buy single dollar without providing the CNIC (computerised national identity card) from the customer.”

"WASHINGTON: Suddenly the online news business is red-hot. Money is flowing into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection from Comcast´s NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200 million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club of ""unicorns,"" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.""Right now it´s an arms race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,"" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of ""millennials,"" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.""Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,"" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch family´s 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.""It´s as much a hedge as anything else,"" Doctor said.""It´s a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.""Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, ""you can see the fault lines,"" Doctor said. ""Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.""The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.""BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,"" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means ""using data science to understand how information is spreading"" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcast´s NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.""We´re seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,"" she told AFP.""We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so I´m sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.""For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.""These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,"" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.""We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,"" Layser said. ""We have not seen a magic bullet that is going to make a clear pathway to profitability.""

"HONG KONG: Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about China´s slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the world´s number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this year´s gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.""Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,"" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.""The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of China´s economy) is inevitable.""Asia´s losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since China´s shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even Beijing´s huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.""This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,"" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.""If we don´t cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.""Oil prices also fell, after breaking below the $40 barrel for the first time in six years Friday on concerns about waning demand in China, the world´s top energy importer.Data showing the number of US drilling rigs rose last week, despite the slump in prices, added to concerns a global supply glut will last for years.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.28 to $39.58 while Brent crude for October eased $1.45 to $44.65.Jitters over China and the global economy saw traders drop the dollar and move into the yen -- a safe haven in times of turmoil and uncertainty -- while the currencies of Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea all hit fresh multi-year lows.The greenback fell to 121.23 yen in Asia Monday, down from 122.06 yen in New York Friday. The euro was at $1.1425 and 138.51 yen, from $1.1386 and 138.97 yen.Gold traded at $1,153.24 compared to $1,154.45 late Friday.In other markets:-- Taipei closed down 4.84 percent, or 376.58 points, at 7,410.34 after posting their biggest ever intra-day decline of 7.49 percent.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co lost 4.96 percent to Tw$115.0 while Hon Hai Precision closed 4.56 percent lower at Tw$81.6.-- Wellington dropped 2.50 percent or 143.87 points to an eight-month low of 5,607.32.Heavyweight Fletcher Building was among the biggest losers, down 3.98 percent at NZ$7.23, while Air New Zealand slipped 0.93 percent to NZ$2.67.

A reading below 50 signifies contraction in activity.The poor data fuelled concerns about the world´s second-largest economy and top energy importer -- already heightened by Beijing´s unexpected devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago -- at a time when high production levels and weak demand growth are weighing on prices.Oil dealers will next be scrutinising preliminary US second-quarter GDP data to be released on Thursday, analysts said.The data could be key to the Federal Reserve´s timeline for raising interest rates, with predictions for a September raise fading in the face of global growth jitters.Interest rate adjustments are closely watched by crude investors as an increase usually leads to a pick-up in the dollar. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand.

"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. “SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies,” said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.“Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.”The statement added that, “Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities.” “SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.”

"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the government´s ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement. The new programme, which runs until 2019, will target six sectors including energy, transport and public sector management, the ADB said.

"Hong Kong: Asian stocks flip-flopped on Wednesday after China cut interest rates in a bid to restore confidence in its sagging economy, with trading volatile after days of heavy swings across world equities.The dollar edged up in Tokyo, after rebounding from this week´s steep losses in New York as nervous investors searched for safety.Tokyo rose 0.40 percent by the break, bouncing after their worst two-day plunge since 2011, and Seoul added 1.05 percent as China´s move to cut rates and free up cash for banks to lend spurred optimism.But Shanghai swiftly gave up gains in opening deals to fall 3.03 percent by mid-morning, and Hong Kong and Sydney both dropped 0.70 percent.China on Tuesday cut its key interest rate and slashed the amount of money banks must hold in reserve for the second time in as many months in a bid to spur growth and end its worst stock market rout in decades.The People´s Bank of China has already cut interest rates five times since November to spur the slowing economy as concerns mount it may miss its seven percent growth target for the year.Fears of stalling growth in China, the world´s number two economy and key driver of world growth, has sent global markets into a tailspin and investors said the cuts alone may not be enough to stem the losses.""The authorities have not been intervening, they have been allowing stocks to go down in price. Assuming that continues to be the case on Wednesday, I do see a continued fall in prices,"" Komal Sri-Kumar, founder of Sri-Kumar Global Strategies, told Bloomberg News.In currency trade, the dollar remained under pressure at 118.96 yen, little changed from 118.84 yen in New York trade Tuesday, but dramatically weaker than the 122.06 yen seen in US trade on Friday.The euro stood at $1.1535 and 137.25 yen in Tokyo, compared with $1.1518 and 136.87 yen in New York overnight.Oil prices held steady ahead of the latest US energy report after heavy losses earlier in the week owing to jitters over China´s faltering economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained four cents to $39.35 while Brent crude for October rose 11 cents to $43.32.Gold traded at $1,137.66 compared to $1,149.80 late Tuesday.In individual shares, BHP Billiton rose 0.81 percent to Aus$23.54 after the global mining giant announced a 86.2 percent slump in annual net profit after trading closed Tuesday.

"Singapore: Oil rose in Asia Thursday as dealers digested a mixed US energy report showing a dip in crude inventories, but barely any decline in production despite sinking prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 86 cents to $39.46 while Brent crude for October rose $1.07 to $44.21 in late-morning trade.The US Department of Energy said Wednesday US crude supplies unexpectedly fell by 5.5 million barrels for the week ending August 21, indicating healthy demand.However, US crude production slipped a scant 11,000 barrels a day in the same period, keeping output above 9.3 million barrels and not far from a decades-high production level.In another bearish indicator, gasoline supplies increased by 1.7 million barrels, adding to concerns of a global glut of energy supplies.Despite the gains in Asian trading, Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said the mixed report compounded ""negative sentiment after worldwide falls in equities that helped drag fuel prices to six and a half year lows"".Oil prices hit their lowest levels since early 2009 on Monday over concerns China´s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped drive its growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago largely fuelled the economic fears that sparked the rout, which also saw heavy losses in most global commodities and equity markets.London-based Capital Economics predicted a rebound in commodities markets, saying that ""much of the bad news was already baked in the cake before the latest sell-off"".""We think commodity prices will now stabilise and perhaps even edge higher and we disagree with the doomsday scenarios for China´s economy that are currently doing the rounds,"" it said.

Our hardworking and enterprising overseas Pakistanis are not only making a mark in their countries of adoption but sending back remittances which are at a record level today.” “Our strategic location gives Pakistan a pivotal role in promoting regional connectivity. Plans are underway to make Pakistan a regional economic hub providing trade energy and communication corridors linking Central Asia to South and South West Asia and beyond.”Earlier, top officials of NASDAQ, Andew Hall and David Wicks congratulated the government and people of Pakistan after Hall introduced Ambassador Lodhi.The Chairman of PABA, M. Siddique Sheikh, President of PABA, Keith Segerson, and active member Sajjad Qamar were among those present at the ceremony which was also attended by Pakistan Consul General Raja Ali Ejaz.“This year’s Independence Day coincides with a remarkable recovery in Pakistan’s economy.

"KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations – those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

"KARACHI: Pakistan is poised to fetch higher export orders for onion this year after India, its competitor, and Bangladesh returned to the international markets to overcome local shortage in supplies, traders have said.""Pakistan has registered an increase in demand from the overseas markets in the last couple of weeks…India has recently started importing onion from Pakistan via the Wagah border,"" said Haji Shahjahan, an exporter.""Total export of the country would remain steady at 450,000 to 500,000 ton this year, which is similar to the previous year,"" he estimated. The country’s annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market. ""Supplies are sometimes slowed down when the crop finishes in one area and harvesting begins in other areas...These days, onions from Balochistan are available in the markets nationwide."" Sindh would begin harvesting the new crop from October, and will continue in full swing until November-December. The crop would last till April 2016.He, however, said Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and UAE remain the biggest importers of Pakistani onion.Attributing the price fluctuation to the demand supply gap, Shahjahan said Malaysia has been importing 50-60 containers (of 25 tons each) every week, UAE 40-50 containers, whereas Sri Lanka buys 30-40 containers of onion from Pakistan every week. ""On a weekly average, Pakistan exports 8,000 to 10,000 tons of onion,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Baloch, another exporter, said ""I have just received an export order from Bangladesh, and I am evaluating the export price.""Reportedly, Bangladesh usually imports onion from India. The export country {India}, however, is itself experiencing shortage in local supplies and price-hike these days. The situation has also convinced Bangladesh to divert its import orders to other countries.Pakistan, a common neighbour to both the countries, with a local production estimated at 2.5 million tons this year, may help them overcome a part of their local shortages.Egypt, Iran, an Afghanistan may also help them overcome the crises, it was learnt.Baloch added that Pakistan could fetch higher exports than the estimated amount if the government did not set a maximum limit per exporter. ""According to the rules, one exporter cannot load more than one container of onion in each vessel… may be each vessel carries 100 containers.""Shahjahan added two to three vessels of onions leave the Karachi Port every week.

"KARACHI: A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the country’s main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.“No one from government’s side came forward to negotiate with us,” he said.“We have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime Minister’s secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.”Even various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agents’ leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.“Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses,” he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.“If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace,” he said. “And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.”He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didn’t issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders don’t work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said government’s non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The country’s exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didn’t seriously take the issue. It was only after 12 days, during which traders sustained huge losses the government came for negotiation with the protestors.He said the present government allows an issue to blow out of proportion before coming for the rescue.Fawad Ijaz Khan, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the government has failed to resolve the issues facing freight forwarders and air cargo agents.“We have been trying to contact the various ministries, including finance and commerce ministries, but no one was available to listen to our grievances,” Khan said.“Our members are worried about their consignments and their orders might be cancelled if not shipped on time.”Shabbir Ahmed, former chairman of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association said the government should seriously take notice of the matter and immediately resolve the issues of the logistics sector. Ahmed said small exporters will suffer the most due to the strike.

"London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised Japan´s nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in Iran´s atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.

"KARACHI: Talks between Milk Retailers Association and Commissioner Karachi, Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui, proved partially fruitful on Tuesday evening which resulted in Dairy and Cattle Farmers Association to split into two factions over the milk price hike.Commissioner Karachi said this evening that the milk shops in the city that were sealed by the government would be opened soon, as most milk retailers were ready to bring down their prices.Meanwhile, a faction of the Dairy and Cattle Farmers Association still refused to bring down the price and some of the milk retailers announced that they would shut the supply of milk in the city tomorrow (Wednesday). They also demanded the release of those vendors who were arrested for six months for selling milk at costly rates.Earlier today, it was reported that a milk shortage had emerged in Karachi as dairy shops in the city had closed over disagreements on the selling price.President Dairy and Cattle Farmers Association Shakir Umer said dairy shops were being sold milk at Rs74/litre. The official price of milk is set at Rs70/litre and shop owners complained they cannot sell at a loss.Shops had also closed across the city over inadequate supply. The President of the Dairy and Cattle Farmers said the city government should listen to their grievances instead of initiating crackdowns.Commissioner Karachi had said they were willing to discuss the sale price of milk and other issues.

"Singapore: Oil prices were mixed in Asia Tuesday after the latest Chinese trade data showed lacklustre demand in the world´s top energy consumer, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.34 to $44.71 while Brent crude for October gained 44 cents to $48.07 in late-morning trade.The Chinese customs administration said Tuesday overseas shipments in August fell 6.1 percent in yuan terms from a year earlier. This compared with a fall of 8.9 percent in July.Imports dropped 14.3 percent, from an 8.6 percent decrease in July.""This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP.""China´s economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,"" he added.The data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the world´s second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth.Oil prices have come under pressure from concerns that China´s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels.Oil prices are down almost 30 percent from this year´s closing peak in May, according to Bloomberg News data.Analysts said dealers would next scrutinise the latest weekly US petroleum report due Thursday, a day later than usual due to a holiday on Monday.US crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak due to high production levels despite tepid demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.

"DUBAI: Dubai property developers are still turning out some larger-than-life projects even though prices are heading south again after clawing back a good chunk of their losses in the 2008 crash.  The Gulf emirate´s annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by what´s going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  ""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the world´s highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the world´s tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break Dubai´s own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.  Dubai´s Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said Dubai´s market has ""matured"" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.

"LAHORE: Traders and business community is observing countrywide complete shutter down strike, halting business activities today (Wednesday) against the imposition of withholding tax on all types of banking transactions.This would be the second countrywide strike on the same issue. Earlier, the business community succeeded in observing the strike across country, pressurising the Federal Board of Revenue to halve the rate of withholding tax on banking transactions, and extending the date of implementation of the said tax.However, a faction of traders refused the FBR incentive, sticking to their single point agenda of withdrawal of the withholding tax from banking transactions, which has compelled the other groups to join hands with them and show their muscle power to the government.On Tuesday, different factions of the traders in two different press conferences announced the complete shutter down strike for today. They said that after this strike, they will announce their future plans of protests and strikes which would be for an indefinite period.They said that businessmen had never refused to pay taxes, but the government instead of taxing those who were already in the net, should bring new people in to the tax net.They said that this tax had not only made life of the traders miserable, but also destroyed the whole banking sector, as it was now facing a collective loss of Rs878 billion.After the traders and business community, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also announced to observe the September 9 strike.

"Hong Kong: Asian markets were relatively calm Friday at the end of a volatile week, with Shanghai and Hong Kong ticking higher after China unveiled a series of steps to shore up its economy, but fears of a US interest rate hike kept dealers on edge.Higher-yielding, or riskier, currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won benefited from a more upbeat outlook, which followed a positive lead from Wall Street, while the Australian dollar edged higher.The safe-haven yen, considered a go-to asset in times of turmoil, retreated.Analysts said world markets seemed to be settling after a roller-coaster ride since China last month devalued its yuan currency, sparking concerns about the world´s number two economy -- the main driver of global growth -- and its leaders´ ability to control the crisis.The broadly upbeat sentiment comes after Beijing sought to reassure investors it was able to maintain high growth, and announced a plan to speed up major construction projects and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises.A set of capital controls to prevent a flight of cash were implemented this week, while analysts said a rise in the offshore yuan Thursday suggested the central bank had intervened to prop it up.Authorities also unveiled a series of measures to prevent huge swings in China´s stock markets, which have seen trillions of dollars wiped off valuations in Shanghai since it hit a peak in mid-June. Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next week´s Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Street´s three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat.

"KARACHI: The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.“With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning,” reads a Nepra’s decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.“Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development,” the authority said.“In short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.”The authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.“The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability,” read the ruling.“An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.”It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.

In fact, this trend may well even accelerate in the near future.""World oil prices have roughly halved in value since a year ago, plagued by a global supply glut caused largely by cheaper production of US oil following extraction from shale rock.Attention is now focused on Washington where the Fed will make an announcement on borrowing costs, with analyst opinion split on whether it will begin lift-off of raising rates on Thursday or wait until December.Fed chief Janet Yellen has said she expects an increase in US interest rates by the end of the year but recent turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about China´s economy have complicated policymakers´ decision-making.A rise in US interest rates tends to bolster the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand.

However, an improved risk tone could cushion oil prices on the downside,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar climbed after three Federal Reserve presidents put the argument for borrowing costs the rise by year´s end, in a bid to soothe concerns about the global economy that were stoked by the bank´s decision to hold fire Thursday.A strong greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.Analysts have said Monday´s strong price rebound looked more like a technical correction from heavy losses last week as the fundamentals of a crude oversupply outrunning demand remained intact.Traders are also closely monitoring progress on Iran´s compliance under a deal with western powers to curb its nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of sanctions that will allow it to export more oil.On Monday, Iran said it independently collected samples at a suspect military site where illicit nuclear work is alleged to have occurred and later handed them to UN inspectors who were not physically present.In an apparent bid to stave off criticism, the chief of the UN´s International Atomic Energy Agency said ""the integrity of the sampling process and the authenticity of the samples"" was not compromised despite the absence of UN inspectors.

"Hong Kong: A plunge in a gauge of Chinese factory activity stoked fresh fears about the world´s number two economy and the global outlook Wednesday, sending Asian markets tumbling after a heavy sell-off in New York and Europe.Emerging market currencies -- already under pressure from an expected US interest rate hike and weak growth -- also took a battering as investors rushed into lower-yielding, or safer, assets such as the yen while oil prices eased.The losses extended a general downward spiral across the world as dealers fret over the state of the global economy, with a US recovery offset by China posting growth at 25-year lows, and Japan and the eurozone also struggling.On Wednesday China´s closely watched Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI) of manufacturing activity for September came in at a six-and-a-half-year low and showed the sector contracted further.The preliminary reading released by financial publisher Caixin came in at 47.0, down from August and missing expectations of 47.5. A result below 50 indicates shrinkage and anything above points to growth.""The decline indicates the nation´s manufacturing industry has reached a crucial stage in the structural transformation process,"" He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a statement accompanying the figures.He blamed the weakness mainly on sluggish external demand for Chinese goods and lower export prices.The figures come a day after the Asian Development Bank (ABD) said it had lowered its growth expectations for Asia because of the sharp growth slowdown in China, a key driver of global trade.""It´s a confirmation of fears that were existing in the market already that China is in fact doing worse than we had been led to believe and there´s a lot of uncertainty about where that economy really is,"" Emma Lawson, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.Among Asian stock markets Shanghai sank 0.88 percent, Hong Kong was 1.90 percent lower and Sydney -- where a number of firms with strong China links are listed -- shed 1.70 percent.Seoul, Taipei and Singapore were also each down more than one percent.

However, Hong Kong continued to drop, shedding 0.44 percent.Tokyo tumbled 2.34 percent by lunch as trading began for the first time since Friday owing to a three-day public holiday.""Japanese markets have still got some catch up to do after the uncertainty that´s been washing through global markets,"" Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities in Sydney, said.""The issue is gauging the extent of the slowdown in China and the ongoing debate about whether the Fed is doing the right thing"" on when to raise interest rates.

"ISLAMABAD: Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies (Discos) by up to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent in 2004 in the power tariff, inflicting a loss of Rs2.1 billion per annum, reveals the government’s official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF, a copy of which is available with The News.Under the circular debt management plan, the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs314 billion (as of end of June 2015) to Rs212 billion by financial year ending June 30, 2018 while keeping within the target of 0.4 percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector (about Rs128 billion) and 4 percent fiscal deficit. “At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. “The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule.” Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner. For the Discos not privatized, the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service.

"PARIS: Air France's human resources manager had his shirt stripped from him as he was ""almost lynched"" on Monday by workers protesting at a plan to cut 2,900 jobs from the struggling airline.Bosses were unveiling a revamped restructuring plan after pilots rejected an earlier proposal to work longer hours. But the board meeting was cut short when hundreds of striking workers stormed into the airline´s headquarters in Roissy, outside Paris.Human resources manager Xavier Broseta ""was almost lynched"", according to one union delegate, and had his shirt ripped off as he clambered over barriers to escape, helped by security guards. CEO Frederic Gagey also made a hasty exit, and the board said the meeting would not resume on Monday.The management condemned the ""physical violence"", and said it would file complaints to the police. Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the violence was ""unacceptable"". ""They do nothing to advance the search for a solution for Air France,"" he said in a statement.The loss-making airline, which employs 52,000 people, is struggling in the face of fierce competition from global rivals.It had tried to convince pilots, who earn up to 250,000 euros ($280,000) a year, to fly 100 more hours annually for the same salary, but talks broke down last week with pilots saying the plan amounted to an effective pay cut. The French government, which owns a 17.6-percent stake, has criticised the pilots, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls denouncing their ""hardline"" attitude.""If Air France does not evolve then it puts itself in danger,"" Valls said at the weekend.- ´Spectators to a crash´ -Four unions announced a strike to coincide with Monday´s meeting. It was not clear how many staff were taking part, but the airline said flights would be unaffected beyond some check-in delays. Not all staff support the pilots, who also led a record-long strike a year ago that cost the company nearly half a billion euros.""Ground staff, stewards and hostesses feel they have made enormous efforts without ending up in a position to influence decisions,"" Beatrice Lestic, of the CFDT union, told Le Parisien newspaper. ""They are now spectators to a crash in which they will be the first victims,"" she said.Seeking to sharpen its competitive edge against main European rivals Lufthansa and British Airways-Iberia, the management´s new proposals include ending five long-haul routes, reducing the frequency of other flights, and selling 14 planes over the next two years.Although the company says it favours voluntary departures, Gagey has indicated compulsory redundancies may be necessary for the first time, ""otherwise we would not make hoped-for progress in terms of productivity"".Sources at Monday´s meeting said the plan includes the possibility of dismissing 300 pilots, 900 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,700 ground staff. The company already shed 5,500 posts via voluntary departures between 2012 and 2014 as it battled competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines. Pilots were also behind a record-long two-week strike in September 2014, which knocked 416 million euros off turnover and was described as ""catastrophic for the French aviation sector"" in a joint statement from key industry unions.The striking pilots opposed the expansion of Air France´s low-cost subsidiary Transavia.Air France, which merged with Dutch national carrier KLM in 2004, is trying to cut costs over two years by 1.8 billion euros.A source close to the deal told AFP Monday that as part of its cost-cutting plan, Air France is to enter into discussions about cancelling all or some of the Boeing 787s it has on order.The airline ordered 25 of the 787-9 Dreamliners in 2011.The source said: ""We are going to contact our suppliers from tomorrow to ask them if possible to cancel the scheduled delivery of the 787 planes.""Discussions will be opened and they could end in cancellations, that´s our approach.""

New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said his side of the talks went to 5 am Monday morning before an agreement was set.The deal is ""profoundly important and beneficial to the generations of people in our respective countries,"" he said.The accord still must be signed and ratified by the respective countries, which also include Singapore and Brunei.In Canada, facing a national election in two weeks, and in the United States, with elections coming in one year, that could prove particularly difficult.US members of Congress have already warned that they will not ratify any deal that gives up too much in US interests.Powerful Senator Orrin Hatch warned Monday that he will scour the deal ""to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congress´s criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers.""

"Singapore: Oil extended gains in Asia Monday as a decline in US drilling pointed to a slowdown in production, but concerns over demand remain after a disappointing US jobs report.A report from Baker Hughes Inc. said the number of active rigs in the United States fell by 26 to 614 last week, the lowest in five years, helping ease concerns over the global crude oversupply that has depressed prices.But poor unemployment data from the US continued to weigh on the market.The US Labor Department said Friday that jobs growth in the world´s biggest economy and top oil consumer faltered in September and the labour market weakened across the board.This has stoked concerns about demand for the commodity at a time when the Chinese economy is also slowing down amid a crude supply glut, analysts said.The US economy added a disappointing 142,000 jobs during the month, well below analyst estimates of 205,000 and the August jobs level of 173,000 was revised sharply lower to 136,000, surprising analysts.The July number also was lowered, bringing the average for the past three months to 167,000 jobs, lagging behind the 200,000-plus growth trend seen earlier in the year and in 2014.The unemployment rate, measuring those without work but actively seeking jobs, was unchanged as expected at 5.1 percent, the lowest level since 2008.The jobs data suggested that the US economy was being affected by the China-driven global slowdown and market volatility.In morning Asia trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was up 11 cents to $45.65 and Brent crude for November jumped 15 cents to $48.28 a barrel.Both contracts also rose on Friday after a decline in US oil drilling bolstered hopes of lower production to ease the global oversupply.""The disappointing US jobs report for September will clearly do little to improve investor confidence in the global economy,"" research house Capital Economics said.""Yes, it will probably delay the first interest rate hike from the Fed until early next year.""Analysts had predicted the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates either this month or in December after policymakers held back during a meeting in September.The Fed has said the timing of a rate increase will depend on the health of the US economy.

"Singapore: Buoyant oil prices sustained a rally in Asia Wednesday driven by hopes the crude supply glut would ease and expectations the US central bank would hold off from raising interest rates.A softening of the US currency also helped bolster prices as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of weaker units, spurring demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery rose 55 cents to $49.08 and Brent crude for November advanced 40 cents to $52.32 a barrel in late-morning trade.Prices fell to six-year lows in August on strong production from the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but have since crept higher.The recent rally began last week after data showed a drop in US drilling activity, raising hopes this would help ease the oversupply.The US Department of Energy has forecast production to decline to an average of 8.9 million barrels per day next year from 9.2 million in 2015.Expectations that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would not raise interest rates this year because of the weak global economy also boosted oil prices, analysts said.""We no longer look for lift-off until the first quarter of 2016. It may not come then either,"" DBS Bank said.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said an interest rate hike seemed less likely after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for the world economy.The global economy will expand just 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF predicted, revising downward its previous forecasts by 0.2 percentage points in both cases.""It is no secret that the IMF wants the Fed to delay its planned rate hike until next year, and the economic undercurrents increasingly lean towards that direction,"" Aw said.""Furthermore, the IMF sees risks for emerging economies.""A rate increase will typically boost the dollar, making oil more expensive, hurting demand and prices.

"ISLAMABAD: Erratic monsoon rains have made it increasingly hard for rice farmer Sardar Muhammad to bring in a good harvest. But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields – rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province – is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.

This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers´ Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears.

Japan´s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to a two-month high.The surprise move by China lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursday´s message from the European Central Bank that it stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates to even deeper negative levels.""These moves by the ECB and China are raising speculation that the Bank of Japan will act later on this week as well,"" Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Friday.The US Federal Reserve is also widely expected to refrain from raising rates at its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.Against these backdrop, the MSCI's index of the world's share markets shot up to its highest level since Aug. 20, having risen more than 10 percent from its two-year low hit less than a month ago.It has recovered most of the losses since Aug. 11, when China's sudden devaluation of the yuan sparked worries its economy may be in deeper trouble than many had thought.On Wall Street, S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to turn positive on the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent.Technology shares led the way, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported earnings results. The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.Mainland Chinese shares rose on Monday after China cut the benchmark one-year lending rate - for the sixth time in less than a year - by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent, and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio late.Gains were fairly limited, however, with Shanghai composite index up just 0.5 percent.Naoki Tashiro, the president of TS China Research, noted that in the week following each of the past year's five rate mainland shares rose three times but fell twice.""Mainland investors are cautious. The market has been rallying so far this month, so some investors could may well take profits into rally,"" he said.One big focus is Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a new five-year plan, while investors attempt to gauge how much China's growth is likely to slow in coming years.Ahead of the central committee meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.Risk sentiment supported by Thursday's message from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing.That saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them.The benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.As negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989 in early Asian trade. It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.""The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound.

"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee on Wednesday slipped to a fresh two-year low of 105.80 against the US dollar in the interbank market, falling 56 paisa from its previous closing. In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country. Currency dealers say the growing demand is due to oil-related payments.""There were a few import payments in the market and banks were already short of them, and as the rupee crossed the 104.50 level it triggered 'stop', surging the rupee past the 105 figure,"" Eman Khan from Tresmark, an application that tracks financial markets, told The News on Tuesday. ""It's no coincidence that it happened on a day when the Finance minister initiated meeting with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and also when economic managers are assessing the damage from the deadly earthquake,"" Khan said. The talks between the IMF officials and the Pakistan's authorities on the ninth review of the extended fund facility program started on Monday in Dubai. Despite strong foreign exchange reserves and narrowing current account deficit, the rupee is constantly losing its value. The rupee depreciated 3.5 percent since the beginning of the current fiscal year.

"Singapore: Oil prices tumbled in Asia Thursday, cutting short a rally the day before after hints of an interest rate hike in December by the US Federal Reserve boosted the dollar.Prices rose Wednesday after the US Department of Energy said the country´s commercial crude stockpiles had increased less than expected, suggesting stronger demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.But the rebound was punctured after the Fed on Wednesday signalled it could raise rates before the end of the year, expressing optimism for the world´s top economy after ""solid"" consumer spending and business investment.""With the Federal Reserve holding off on interest rates hikes on Wednesday, the market will keep watch on the December meeting where a rate hike is likely in play,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.At around 0330 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 16 cents lower at $45.78 and Brent crude for December was down 21 cents at $48.84.US oil prices jumped more than six percent in Wednesday´s session after news domestic crude supplies rose less than expected in the week ending October 23.The news helped ease some fears over a glut of world supplies that experts warn could last well into next year, which has seen oil prices more than halve from last year´s highs.But the rally was cut short when the US central bank explicitly pointed to the possibility of a rate hike in its next meeting in December, dampening market predictions it could be held off until March.The news pushed the dollar higher -- an interest rate hike is bullish for the dollar as it attracts investors to the currency in the quest for higher returns.But because oil is traded in dollars, a strong US currency will make the commodity more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand and prices.""We are still expecting the Fed rate normalisation to be an eventuality and the latest Federal Open Market Committee decision further reaffirms our expectation for the first hike (since 2006) to take place in the 15-16 December 2015 FOMC (meeting),"" United Overseas Bank said.

"Tokyo: Asian stocks dipped in early trade Monday, while the dollar retreated against most regional currencies as a weak reading in a Chinese manufacturing index stirred worries about the world´s number two economy.On equity markets, there were losses across the board as Sunday data showed activity in China´s vast manufacturing sector declined in October for the third straight month, triggering worries about the Chinese economy, a crucial driver of global growth.Investors also turned to profit taking after equity markets surged last month, recovering from their worst quarter in four years during July-September, as analysts said fresh cues were needed for markets to rally further.China´s Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI), tracking activity in the factory and workshop sector, was unchanged from the previous month at 49.8, the state statistics office said Sunday.A PMI figure above 50 signals expanding activity while anything below indicates shrinkage.""I´m struggling to see catalysts to encourage the market to take this rally to the next level,"" said Tony Farnham, a strategist at Patersons Securities Ltd.""China´s PMI numbers were underwhelming. Manufacturing will probably remain weak as China tries to rebalance its economy away from manufacturing and into services.""Tokyo was down 1.87 percent by the lunch break on the weak figures, Hong Kong fell 0.60 percent in early trade and Shanghai dropped 0.38 percent.

"Singapore: Oil prices rebounded in Asia Tuesday, buoyed by bargain hunting ahead of the release of US government data that will gauge crude demand in the world´s biggest economy.Analysts expect the data to be released Wednesday by the US Energy Department to show that commercial crude stockpiles rose in the week to October 30 which typically means weaker demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.Despite occasional rallies, oil remains generally bogged down by a global crude supply glut that has outpaced demand and depressed prices for more than a year.""Expectations of more US stockpiles restrained oil bulls,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.A global economic slowdown led by China has hammered demand for the commodity and highlighted worries that there may not be enough economic activity to soak up excess supplies as output levels from oil producing nations remain high.China´s official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector showed activity shrank in October for the third straight month.Russian oil production broke a post-Soviet record in October, climbing to 10.78 million barrels per day, according to Bloomberg News.At around 0310 GMT Tuesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was up 16 cents at $46.30 and Brent crude for December was trading 11 cents higher at $48.90 a barrel.Prices dipped on Monday after data showed China´s manufacturing output continued to contract and Russian oil production hit a new record high.Current price levels are more than 50 percent lower from their peaks in June 2014 when a barrel of oil was selling at over $100.

"London: The oil market rose on Friday but gains were limited by the global supply glut and after the US Federal Reserve hinted at a December interest rate hike.In midday deals in London, Brent North Sea crude for December won 44 cents to stand at $48.42 per barrel.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December rose 26 cents to $45.46 per barrel compared with Thursday´s close. Despite the slender gains, prices are lower compared with the previous week as the market struggles with a crude oversupply and weak demand owing to sluggish global growth led by top energy guzzler China.Increasing talk of an interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve has also bolstered the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.A meeting last month of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) hinted that a decision to implement the first rate hike since 2006 could be made during a December meeting.Comments this week by Fed chair Janet Yellen and New York Fed president Bill Dudley considered as ""hawkish"" by the market have firmed up expectations for the December FOMC meeting ""as a live possibility for the first Fed rate hike in nearly a decade,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said.Markets are watching the US non-farm payrolls data to be released later Friday for further signs about the health of the US economy which could help swing any decision on interest rates, it said.The data is a closely watched gauge of the unemployment situation in the world´s biggest economy and top oil consuming nation.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in June last year.The International Monetary Fund has projected slower growth for the world economy this year and next.

"LIMASSOL: Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the country’s economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the government’s commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.“We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central bank’s accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sector’s loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moody’s Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moody’s forecasts Pakistan’s real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks’ asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks’ creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation – a result of weaker profitability.Moody’s expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the market’s perception of Pakistan’s risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks’ deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks’ funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moody’s expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets – defined as cash and bank placements – at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.

""One of the main reasons is that we will launch our own national missile project,"" added the official.The news came as Turkey hosted key Western allies including US President Barack Obama but also Chinese leader Xi Jinping for the summit of G20 top economies in the Mediterranean resort of Antalya.Turkey entered negotiations in 2013 with the China Precision Machinery Import-Export Corporation (CPMIEC) to finalise a contract worth $3.4 billion (3 billion euros).French-Italian consortium Eurosam and US-listed Raytheon Co had also submitted offers but the government had prioritised talks with the Chinese company, which raised serious concerns over the compatibility of CPMIEC´s systems with NATO missile defences.NATO has said missile systems within the alliance must be compatible with each other while calling on Turkey to take this factor into account.Turkish government sources said an official announcement was expected next week. A second Turkish official said the issue of technology transfer was one of the major stumbling blocks in negotiations with the Chinese company.""They refused to give what we demanded,"" the official told AFP, without elaborating. ""The talks were blocked at some point.""Although the government´s current plans to build Turkish-made missile defence system, it was not immediately clear if Ankara would launch talks with the European and American contenders.Washington was particularly irked by Turkish decision to negotiate with the Chinese company, which has been hit by a series of US sanctions for selling arms and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.Turkey in the past made confusing comments over its lucrative tender, with a government minister saying the Chinese company was the winner and that its system could be used without integrating with NATO systems.But a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had insisted that the missile system would be harmonious and integrated with NATO defence architecture.

"Hong Kong: Asian stock markets tumbled and the euro lost ground early Monday in the first trades after the deadly weekend terror attacks in Paris.The late-night assault on Friday in French capital, which killed 129 people, sparked concerns about security in Europe and its impact on the already struggling eurozone economy.It also sowed fresh uncertainty in already nervous markets, which ended last week on a low owing to increasing worries about the state of the global economy.Losses across Asian stock markets were joined by a fall in the euro, which is already under pressure from expectations the European Central Bank will loosen monetary policy to shore up the eurozone.""There is no doubt that the attacks in Paris will contribute to short-term investor nervousness,"" Shane Oliver, Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors, said.However, he added that he expected the Paris-linked losses to be brief and pointed out that markets had bounced back from initial selling following past terror attacks.""I think history will repeat itself. It will just be a short selloff in response to the Paris attacks,"" he told Bloomberg News.In early trade Hong Kong was 1.2 percent off, Tokyo fell one percent and Sydney gave up 0.9 percent.Adding to selling pressure in Tokyo Monday was data showing the Japanese economy had slipped into recession for the second time in three years, throwing into question the government´s much-vaunted drive to kickstart growth and inflation.- Shanghai retreats -The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.2 percent in July-September, or 0.8 percent on an annualised basis, marking the second straight quarterly decline -- a technical recession.The preliminary figure was worse than the 0.1 percent decline forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and will put pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up its bond-buying scheme of monetary easing. The central bank is scheduled to hold a policy meeting this week.The soft results continue to flow despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe´s big-spending three-year plan -- dubbed ""Abenomics"" -- to revitalise the torpid economy and end years of debilitating deflation.Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute, told AFP: ""Companies are reluctant to invest despite their sound profits."" He added that while consumer spending improved ""its overall trend still remains weak"".In China, authorities doubled the deposit required for investors to borrow funds to trade stocks -- known as margin trading -- as they try to limit a practice that led a massive market bubble and summer rout.The minimum requirement for margin trading was hiked to 100 percent from 50 percent, meaning traders must have the same level of funds in their accounts as the amount they want to borrow.Margin trading was behind a stock market rally that sent the Shanghai index up 150 percent in a year, before it crashed in June.The move comes as Shanghai rebounds from the summer volatility, with the benchmark index now up 22 percent from its August low.

"Singapore: Oil prices extended gains in Asia Tuesday but the uptick was capped as investors waited for data on US crude stockpiles expected to further underscore a global supply glut.Prices pushed higher on Monday after US-led coalition jets bombed the Daesh group´s oil operations following the deadly attacks on Paris, but analysts said the impact of geopolitical tensions on the oil market is limited.At around 0300 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was up six cents to $41.80 and Brent crude for January was trading 11 cents higher at $44.67 a barrel.The gains on WTI ""are really an exercise to defend the $40 handle, where we saw a 4.0 percent rebound after prices touched lows of $40.06,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""It´s difficult to see more upside potential, although we might be getting closer to the equilibrium price level where we meet the sweet spot in the supply and demand equation,"" he told AFP.He said investors are also cautious ahead of a US Department of Energy report Wednesday on commercial crude stockpiles in the week ending November 13.Analysts expect another build in the inventories, which would indicate weaker demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.BMI Research said the geopolitical tensions sparked by the escalation of military action against IS following the Paris attacks is unlikely to be a major influence on oil prices.It pointed out in a commentary that the global market remains oversupplied, crude inventories in developed countries are at record levels and there is no direct threat to Middle East oil facilities and transit points.""There is no material threat to the oil-producing facilities and transit routes in the Middle East from the escalation of the French military effort in Syria,"" it said.""Namely, this refers to the oil facilities of Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, southern Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), as well as the strategic chokepoints of Suez Canal, Bab el-Mandab and the Straits of Hormuz, all of which remain out of reach of military campaigns.""

"KARACHI:  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.

"ISLAMABAD: The government has old wine to offer in a new bottle to appease both the IMF and the traders in its bid to broaden the tax base. The strategy, however, offers no promise to arrest the flow of smuggled goods, one of the key reasons for the undocumented economy. The tax amnesty scheme for whitening black money of traders will be treated as “regularisation of money” as the IMF is opposed to any kind of amnesty. The government sees no other option to bring traders in the tax net, according to a well-placed official. Compared to past amnesty schemes, this measure will be for traders only. Although the government has taken a bold decision of daring traders community, the constituency of the ruling party, the current scheme lacks any strategy for checking the smuggled items that are available at cheap rates but without any invoicing, generating a chain of undocumented income and tax evasion at multiple level.“It is hard to fix all issues at once but we are trying to raise the cost of undocumented business through taxing banking transactions,” said an official privy to the ongoing deliberations when asked about the challenges to economy from the smuggled goods.Instead, the government is more focused on bringing the traders into the tax net by exempting them from tax audit at least for three-year allowing them declare their hidden assets and bank accounts, and in return they will gradually increase their tax payments during the amnesty period.“We have reminded traders that the era of benami transactions is going to be over soon,” said a tax official with reference to the legislation being drafted for tabling in Parliament early next year suggesting heavy penalty for offenders.The government will grant amnesty to the traders having undeclared assets if the declarations are made in the tax return and such return filers continue increasing their tax payment by 25% during the financial years exempted from scrutiny.Unlike the complicated tax return form for the regular taxpayers, one-page tax return is being designed for the traders in English and Urdu both benefiting from this scheme in order to facilitate their entry into the tax net.Another issue regarding the sales tax on the turnover is also being reduced from one percent to 0.25% in order to settle down long-standing dispute between the FBR and the traders. The traders have been objecting turnover on the total cost of product instead of total sale.Among other measures to address their concerns, regional-level committees of traders have been formed for meetings with the regional tax commissioners to discuss ways and means for ironing out differences.Right now, the government is in contact with two groups of traders headed by Khalid Pervez and Naeem Mir, both are Lahore-based.The former is said to be non-cooperative as he tends to politicise the entire issues even the tax notices that he received months ago alleging him of mis-declaration of bank accounts and assets.In tax year 2013, he declared a book shop in Urdu Bazara as his only business in addition to foreign remittances of four millions rupees and property income of three millions and paid tax Rs49,992, according to an FBR official. This was in contrast with the six undeclared bank accounts and plots as well as eight vehicles spotted by the FBR forming basis of issuing him a notice.Naeem Mir, on the other hand, has been cooperative and urging the government to launch an awareness campaign in order to counter the false propaganda, address their legitimate concerns in addition to educating traders about the benefits of being in the tax net.

"London: World oil prices rose this week on concerns that heightened geopolitical tensions could disrupt Middle East supplies despite a market awash with crude.Traders were turning their attention to next week´s OPEC output meeting to see if the oil producers´ cartel will slash high output levels.The 12-nation OPEC, which counts the world´s biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia among its members as well as Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, holds a regular meeting in Vienna on December 4.Most analysts expect the cartel to stick to its decision taken at the last meeting in June, when OPEC defied calls to cut output despite sliding oil prices, so extending its strategy of preserving market share and fending off competition from the US shale energy boom.Keeping the status quo would see the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries´ official production target left at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for four years -- following pressure from cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia on the other members.""We continue to believe that there will not be any change in Saudi or OPEC policy"" in Vienna, noted Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner.""Oil market oversupply will continue through next year, due to resilient US production -- even if it is declining -- high OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the gradual return of Iran starting in"" 2016, he added.OPEC member Iran last week said it would not negotiate with the cartel over a planned half million barrels per day oil production hike once sanctions are lifted.Despite a supply glut that has caused crude prices to more than halve over the past 18 months -- due primarily to high output from US shale rock but also owing to weaker Chinese demand -- Iran has consistently said it plans to up its output when nuclear-related sanctions are lifted under a deal agreed in July with world powers.Downward pressure on the oil market this week was meanwhile capped by the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.But reports that Russia is not taking military action against Turkey in retaliation eased fears that the tense situation in the region could escalate and disrupt Middle East oil supplies.Moscow said retaliatory measures would focus on using its leverage to tighten the screws on Turkey´s economy, including halting joint economic projects.Next week will see traders monitoring also the meeting of the Federal Reserve, when policymakers are expected to lift US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. A hike would likely boost the dollar, making oil priced in the US unit more expensive for holders of weaker currencies.By late Friday in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in January edged higher to $44.93 a barrel from $44.66 a barrel one week earlier.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January stood at $42.02 a barrel compared with $40.39 for the expired December contract one week earlier.

"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistan´s three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of December´s approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didn´t do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistan´s import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.

"Singapore: Oil prices rose in Asia Tuesday, three days before an OPEC meeting in which the cartel is expected to maintain high output levels despite a global supply glut.Analysts say the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is likely to focus more on maintaining market share against competitors than on slashing production in order to lift prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up 29 cents to $41.94 and Brent crude for January was trading 18 cents higher at 44.79 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.""Crude oil remained on the soft side as many expect OPEC to be unwaving about its production target when the group gathers this Friday,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""Crude prices are likely to stay sideways ahead of the OPEC meeting, where Iran is expected to announce plans to expand output.""Iran is expected to increase its oil exports after crippling western sanctions are lifted under a landmark deal reached with major world powers in July to curb its nuclear programme.The sanctions have restricted Iranian oil shipments and analysts say their return to the market will further add to the crude oversupply.Iran´s deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi said last week his country expects the deal to come into force in early January, when Tehran will have implemented its commitments.Oil prices have been in retreat from levels above $100 a barrel reached in mid-2014, with the decline accelerating after OPEC´s November 2014 meeting signalled the group would keep output high.A key measure of China´s manufacturing activity dropped to its weakest level in more than three years in November, data released Tuesday showed, further underlining weaknesses in the world´s top energy consumer.The official Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), which tracks activity in the crucial factories and workshops sector, fell to 49.6, the government statistics bureau said. It was the fourth consecutive month of decline and the lowest figure since August 2012.

"Hong Kong: Asian markets saw fresh volatility Wednesday, with Shanghai seeing sharp swings, as weak factory activity data highlighted weakness in the global economy but fuelled hopes central banks will stick to a loose monetary policy.The euro also held its own after rallying in New York as a surprisingly positive set of eurozone figures raised the possibility the European Central Bank will delay an expected stimulus boost.Official figures showing a gauge of Chinese manufacturing activity hit a three-year low in November was followed later in the day by news that US factory work contracted at the fastest pace since June 2009.While the US economy, the world´s biggest, has shown strong signs it is well on track to recovery, traders remain nervous about the future, with commodity prices at multi-year lows and the dollar soaring, hitting exports.""Traditionally, the manufacturing sector has been the canary in the coal mine when it comes to slowing growth.

"Vienna: The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has decided against cutting its oil output to lift prices, its president and Nigerian oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu said following a meeting here Friday.OPEC, whose members together pump out more than one third of world oil, is currently producing above its official target of 30 million barrels per day.""Given the present position of the economy of countries that are purchasing (oil) and the worldwide economy, we will retain production at current levels,"" said Kachikwu, who is minister of state for petroleum resources in Nigeria.OPEC is currently pumping out around 32 million barrels of oil per day.The cartel on Friday published no figures on output in its communique, as it awaits increased output from Iran after sanctions were lifted on the Islamic republic.""We cannot put a number now because Iran is coming, we don´t know when Iran will come, and we will have to accommodate Iran one way or the other,"" said OPEC Secretary General Abdullah el-Badri.""We decided to postpone this decision to the next OPEC meeting (in June) until the picture will be more clearer for us to decide on a number,"" he added.Despite oil prices plunging by more than 60 percent in 18 months, OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and the cartel´s other Gulf state members are defying calls to reduce output -- in a year-long strategy of attempting to preserve market share and fend off competition from non-OPEC and world leading producers Russia and the United States.Saudi Arabia on Friday repeated the kingdom´s stance that it would be willing to cut as long as non-OPEC also reduces its output.""We have said on more than one occasion that we are willing to cooperate with anyone that will help balance the market... with us,"" Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi told reporters gathered at OPEC headquarters in Vienna.OPEC´s poorer nations -- notably Venezuela, Ecuador and Algeria -- had led the calls for a cut to help boost prices and in turn their badly-hit revenues.""Everyone is concerned about... the prices, no one is happy,"" said Iraq´s oil minister Adil Abd Al-Mahdi.OPEC on Friday confirmed that Indonesia had returned to the cartel after a near seven-year absence, bringing the number of member countries to 13.

"London: World stock markets churned lower Friday on lingering disappointment over ""underwhelming"" eurozone stimulus measures and ahead of key US jobs data.Equities had plunged Thursday as the European Central Bank´s latest stimulus plan disappointed investors, sparking a global sell off that spilled over into Wall Street and Asia.In late Friday morning deals, London lost another 0.2 percent, Frankfurt fell 0.6 percent and Paris also slid 0.6 percent, one day after the key indices shed between two and four percent in value.Speculation had swirled for weeks that the ECB would ramp up its bond-buying programme and loosen monetary policy to bolster growth and counter weak inflation.Hopes were stoked Wednesday by news that eurozone inflation languished at 0.1 percent in November -- far lower than the ECB´s official 2.0-percent target.The bank on Thursday cut deposit rates further into negative territory -- meaning lenders must pay to park cash with it and so look to loan more -- and extended the length of its bond purchases.- Huge let-down -However, the long-awaited announcement was seen as a huge let-down as it crucially failed to increase the size of the stimulus while the rate cut was less than hoped for.""Equity markets took a notable shake out yesterday in response to the underwhelming actions of the ECB,"" said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.""The central bank´s stimulus measures fell some way short of expectations, initiating degree of panic across the board.""This rattled US markets after the European close last night and is once again taking a toll in early trade as the week´s final session gets underway.""The news sent the euro surging on Thursday to a one-month peak at $1.0981, having earlier hit a 7.5-month low of $1.0524 in highly volatile deals.""Draghi failed to deliver on investors´ expectations,"" said ETX Capital analyst Daniel Sugarman.""In November the ECB governor had stated that the ECB would ´do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible´ -- which investors took to mean the unveiling of a significant surge in monetary stimulus in December.""The single currency had come under fierce selling pressure leading up to the announcement as dealers positioned themselves for more far-reaching measures.- Fed caution -The euro´s gains were also given support after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said the bank remained wary of a US interest rate rise because of concerns about a strong dollar and other central banks´ loose monetary policies.While the Fed is still widely expected to lift rates this month -- for the first time in nine years -- Yellen´s comments caused traders to baulk after a recent run-up in the dollar. Dealers are now awaiting the release of key US jobs data later in the day, although analysts say the report would need to be monstrously bad to prevent a Fed rate rise in December.Asian stocks finished in the red, with Tokyo down 2.2 percent, Shanghai shedding 1.7 percent and Sydney 1.5 percent lower.Oil prices rose Friday amid OPEC´s policy meeting in Vienna, where the cartel appears on course to maintain crude production levels despite a recent plunge to underneath $40 per barrel.- Key figures around 1130 GMT -London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,263 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.6 percent at 10,728Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.6 percent at 4,702 EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.4 percent at 3,149Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.2 percent at 19,504.48 (close)New York - Dow: DOWN 1.4 percent at 17,477.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0876 from $1.0947 in late US trade on ThursdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.80 yen from 122.61 yen

He said if the opposition has objections over the ordinance, it can go ahead and present a resolution for its rejection in the lower house. He said the matter will be discussed with the opposition leader in the National Assembly and thereupon the speaker may constitute a committee to look into the issue.Defending the government’s decision to impose additional taxes, Ishaq Dar said there was a tax shortfall of Rs40 billion. He said taxes have either been imposed or raised only items that fall in the category of luxury goods.He said 58 percent of the proceeds from additional taxes will go to the provinces’ kitty while the federation will only receive its one third.

"London: Global oil prices tanked on Friday close to seven-year lows on oversupply woes, sparking a fresh wave of selling on European and US stock markets as panicked investors fled the energy sector. Crude, which has slumped since OPEC left its oil output at a record high level last week, took another tumble after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oversupply would persist until late 2016. In response, Brent crude futures for January delivery collapsed to $38.90 per barrel -- a level last seen on December 31, 2008, during the global financial crisis. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in January dived to $36.12 -- last witnessed in February 2009. ""Comments from the IEA have ... seen both WTI and Brent fall aggressively, after they (indicated) that the unrelenting supply would see oil prices lower into the new year,"" said analyst James Hughes at trading firm GKFX. Traders were also positioning themselves before the weekend and next Wednesday´s expected interest rate hike, the first in nine years, from the US Federal Reserve. The prospect of higher rates boosts the greenback, which in turn makes dollar-priced crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies. That tends to weigh on oil demand and pull prices lower. ""Oil prices have fallen heavily again this morning as the commodity rout continues to dominate the week,"" Hughes told AFP. ""Prices have tumbled yet again as many investors try and position themselves ahead of the weekend, and also next week´s key Fed decision."" Oil has collapsed by more than 10 percent since the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided against cutting output despite plunging prices, weak global demand and the stubborn supply glut. That has sent shockwaves across world equity markets because low oil prices slash profits for energy majors like BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell. In mid-afternoon trading, major European markets saw early losses deepen with the London FTSE 100 index shedding 1.8 percent to drop below the 6,000 mark, while Frankfurt and Paris lost 2.2 percent in value. BP´s share price slid 3.2 percent to 339.80 pence and Shell´s ´B´ shares dropped 4 percent to 1,498 pence and Anglo American shed 7 percent in a London session which saw just two FTSE 100 firms in positive territory. French giant Total saw its stock sink 3 percent. US stocks opened more than one percent lower, with investors selling down industrial heavyweights Dow Chemical and DuPont after they confirmed plans to merge. Ten minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.26 percent with the broad-based S&amp;P 500 and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index similarly heading south. Dow Chemical and DuPont both gave up about half the sharp gains that came Wednesday on leaked news of their mega-merger, losing 3.9 percent and 5.8 percent respectively. Most Asian markets also sank at the end of a painful week for global equities defined by a commodities rout which analysts expect to continue. With the global economy struggling, China´s growth subdued and the dollar tipped to strengthen further, oil is expected to remain beaten down until possibly 2017. Shares in Hong Kong sank 1.1 percent -- a seventh-successive loss -- with CNOOC and PetroChina leading energy firms lower. On other markets Shanghai slipped 0.9 percent, but bargain-buying and a weaker yen helped Tokyo rally. - Key figures around 1500 GMT - London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.8 percent at 5,979 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 2.2 percent at 10,362Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 2.2 percent at 4,531EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 2.0 percent at 3,206New York - Dow Jones: DOWN 1.3 percent at 17,353.27Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 19,230.48 (close)Euro/dollar: UP to $1.1021 from $1.0939 late in New York on Thursday.Dollar/yen: UP to 121.70 yen from 121.62 yen",12-11-2015,Global stock selloff on seven year oil ,business

"strong>SINGAPORE: Crude oil futures fell around half a dollar early on Wednesday as the market remained under pressure from slowing demand and high supplies, while forecasts that a cold snap in Europe and the United States would be short-lived also hurt prices.</strongCrude prices have plunged by two-thirds since mid-2014 as soaring output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and the United States led to a global surplus of between half a million and 2 million barrels per day.More recently, a slowing demand outlook, especially in Asia but also Europe, has started dragging on prices.Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were trading at $37.18 per barrel at 0140 GMT, down 69 cents or 1.82 percent from their last settlement. Brent futures were down 47 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $37.32 a barrel.Traders said the price falls were largely a result of a weak outlook for next year and the closing of 2015 trade books.""The 2016 outlook is for lower prices, especially early next year.

"strong>NEW YORK/LONDON: Oil prices rose on Thursday but fell as much as 35 percent for the year after a race to pump by Middle East crude producers and U.S. shale oil drillers created an unprecedented global glut that may take through 2016 to clear.</strongGlobal oil benchmark Brent and U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose between 1 and 2 percent on the day on short-covering and buying support in a thinly traded market ahead of the New Year holiday.But for 2015, both benchmarks fell double-digits for a second straight year as Saudi Arabia and other members of the once-powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) again failed to boost oil prices.The U.S. shale industry, meanwhile, surprised the world again with its ability to survive rock-bottom crude prices, churning out more supply than expected, even as the sell-off in oil slashed by two-thirds the number of drilling rigs in the country from a year ago.The United States also took a historic move in repealing a 40-year ban on U.S. crude exports to countries outside Canada, acknowledging the industry's growth.""You do have to tip your hat to the U.S. shale industry and their ongoing ability to drive down costs and hang in there, albeit by their fingernails,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, an energy hedge fund in New York.Brent crude settled up 82 cents at $37.28 a barrel, rebounding from a near 11-year low of $36.10 hit earlier in the session. For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Niño weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.""We have brimming oil inventories in Europe,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. ""And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.""Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that ""headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.""The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. ""The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks,"" it said.strong>INDUSTRY PAIN</strongBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.",01-01-2016,Oil ends 2015 down 35 per,business

"LONDON: Oil prices slid more than 4 percent to new 11-year lows on Wednesday as the row between Saudi Arabia and Iran made any cooperation between major exporters to cut output even more unlikely.The furore over Saudi Arabia´s execution of a Shi´ite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.""There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.""Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising,"" Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that China´s services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The People´s Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the world´s largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United States, concerns over mounting oil stock levels persisted, with crude inventories likely to have risen by 439,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish its closely watched weekly data at 1530 GMT.Some analysts think oil prices have fallen too far and will stage a sharp recovery later in the year, with Commerzbank targeting $60 per barrel by the end of 2016.""This looks ambitious from current levels but current prices are unsustainably low,"" Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank, told the Global Oil Forum.""We are in a speculative exaggeration at the moment.""He added that he expects US oil production to fall at least 1 million bpd by autumn. ",01-06-2016,Oil slides to new 11 year low over Saudi Iran r,business

"LONDON: The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shi´ite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the world´s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016.

In June it had forecast 0.7 percent GDP growth for 2016. The bank estimates the Russian economy shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.In Brazil, GDP is forecast to decline by 2.5 percent in 2016 compared with an earlier estimate for growth of 1.1 percent, the World Bank said. The Brazilian economy likely contracted at a 3.7 percent rate in 2015.China GDP growth was estimated to slow to 6.7 percent in 2016 from an estimated 6.9 percent in 2015.

"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices hit their lowest since 2003 on Monday, as the market braced for a jump in Iranian exports after the lifting of sanctions against the country at the weekend.</strongThe UN nuclear watchdog on Saturday said Tehran had met its commitments to curtail its nuclear programme, and the United States immediately revoked sanctions that had slashed the OPEC member's oil exports by around 2 million barrels per day (bpd) since their pre-sanctions 2011 peak to little more than 1 million bpd.""Iran is now free to sell as much oil as it wants to whomever it likes at whatever price it can get,"" said Richard Nephew, program director for Economic Statecraft, Sanctions and Energy Markets at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.Iran is ready to increase its crude exports by 500,000 bpd, its deputy oil minister said on Sunday.In what traders described as a knee-jerk reaction, international Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel early on Monday, its lowest since 2003, before recovering to $28.56 by 0208 GMT, still down over 1 percent from its settlement on Friday.US crude was down 27 cents at $29.15 a barrel, after hitting a 2003-low of $28.36 earlier in the session.""The lifting of sanctions on Iran should see further downward pressure on oil ... in the short term,"" ANZ said on Monday.""Iran's likely strategy in offering discounts to entice customers could see further downward pressure on prices in the near term,"" the bank added.Trading data shows that short positions in US crude markets, which would profit from further price falls, have hit a fresh record despite steep recent drops.While this could trigger sudden price jumps once traders close positions to cash in from further drops, it also indicates that many market participants think there is still more downside to prices.Iran's potential new exports come at a time when global markets are already reeling from chronic oversupply as producers pump a million barrels or more of crude every day in excess of demand, pulling down crude prices by over 75 percent since mid-2014 and by over a quarter since the start of 2016.And although analysts expect Iran to take some time before being able to fully revive its export infrastructure, suffering from years of underinvestment during the sanctions, it does have at least a dozen Very Large Crude Carrier super-tankers filled and in place to sell into the market.The oil price rout is also hurting stock markets, with Asian shares set to slide to near their 2011 troughs on Monday, stoking further worries about a global economic downturn.""Growth keeps slowing ...

Pakistan should do the same, he added.Due to good policies of the government, Pakistan has survived from being bankrupt, he remarked.Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar in his welcome remarks said due to prudent reform initiatives of the government the tax to GDP ratio had risen from 8.5 percent to 10 percent while the revenues had registered 18.2 percent growth.“We are on the track and economic indicators are showing improvement,” he added.Ishaq Dar further said that GDP growth in fiscal year was 4.24 percent which was the highest in seven years and it would be further increased to 5 percent in current financial year.Fiscal deficit he said would be brought down to 4.3percent in the current fiscal year.He also informed that for Benazir Income Support Program (BISP) allocations had been increased three times.Dar said previous governments did not give proper attention on energy generation which created energy crisis in the country.He added the government had initiated a number of energy projects and by 2018 10 000 MW more electricity would be added in the system.Ahsan Iqbal on the occasion highlighted the government’s vision 2025 initiated for the benefit of the country and its people.He said that China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) had been initiated at a cost of US 46 billion which would be a game change not only for Pakistan but the entire region.",02-09-2016,WB president for Pakistan to invest in people to boost economy,business

"strong>LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.</strongThe agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.”",02-09-2016,IEA sees global oil glut worsening OPEC deal unlikely,business

""We have repeatedly said that Iran will increase its crude output until reaching the pre-sanctions<br/>production level.""The freeze plan has so far failed to push up oil prices, due to concerns Iran would not participate and that a deal would do little to ease the global glut as it would still allow Russia and Saudi Arabia to keep pumping at near record levels.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino, Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada sat down with Zanganeh at 3 p.<br/>m.

"strong>TOKYO: Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use ""all policy tools – monetary, fiscal and structural – individually and collectively"" to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.""The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it,"" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.""In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it,"" he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to ""consult closely"" on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rate""The US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of ""Brexit"" offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against ""Brexit"" in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.",2/29/2016,Asian shares slip after G20 Fed ang,business

"strong>SINGAPORE: Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia is expected to raise prices for most of the crude it sells to Asia in April, following robust demand for Middle East grades, trade sources said on Tuesday.</strongThe official selling price (OSP) for flagship Arab Light could rise by about 50 cents a barrel from March, a Reuters survey of five refiners showed.Benchmark Dubai prices fell below $30 a barrel at the start of this year, boosting demand for Middle East and Russian crude in Asia.That pushed up prompt prices against future-dated ones, narrowing the market´s contango structure, one of the triggers for the OPEC kingpin to raise prices.""In theory, it (Arab Light) will go up 60-70 cents,"" a trader with a North Asian refiner said, but added that a rise of 30-40 cents was more likely as it would have to compete with crude from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).The approach of the peak summer driving season in the United States may support a bigger price hike for Arab Extra Light on stronger demand for gasoline blendstock, he said.Three of the respondents expect Saudi Arabia to limit the price increase for Arab Heavy as the grade has become more expensive than Iraqi Basra Light for March.Basra Light crude loading in March, with an API gravity of 30 degrees, is 15 cents a barrel cheaper than Arab Heavy, a second North Asian refiner said.Saudi crude OSPs are usually released around the fifth of each month, and set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia.State oil giant Saudi Aramco sets its crude prices based on recommendations from customers and after calculating the change in the value of its oil over the past month, based on yields and product prices.Saudi Aramco officials as a matter of policy do not comment on the kingdom´s monthly OSPs.",03-01-2016,Saudi Arabia expected to raise April crude prices to Asi,business
"strong>SINGAPORE: Gold dipped for a second straight session on Wednesday, as global equities and the dollar rose following strong US manufacturing data that rekindled speculation of a Federal Reserve interest rate hike this year.</strongOther safe-haven assets also fell, with the Japanese yen nursing broad losses, having suffered a big reversal overnight as traders in London and New York took a brighter view on the global economy.Spot gold slipped 0.4 percent to $1,226.56 an ounce by 0247 GMT, after dropping 0.5 percent in the previous session.""The selling (in gold) will likely continue going into Wednesday's session, especially if we see another round of strong buying set in over global equity markets,"" said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir.""All this goes to show us that gold still remains very much in the orbit of US equities and we suspect that this will remain the case for some time to come,"" he said.The US S&amp;P 500 Index jumped to an eight-week high on Tuesday. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped to their highest since early January on Wednesday.Shares got a boost after data showed US manufacturing appeared to stabilize in February, with production accelerating and new orders holding steady at higher levels.The economic outlook was further bolstered by another report on construction spending that scaled a more than eight-year high in January.The US dollar rebounded against the yen and hit one-month highs against the euro on Tuesday, making commodities priced in the greenback expensive for holders of other currencies.Investors will be watching more US data to gauge the impact on stocks and the Fed's monetary policy, with the most important one being US non-farm payrolls on Friday.So far this year, gold has gained 16 percent as turmoil in equity markets and concerns over the global economy triggered speculation that the Fed will not raise US interest rates any further this year. The US central bank hiked rates for the first time in nearly a decade in December.For now, gold is also drawing support from flows into bullion-backed exchange traded funds (ETF). Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold ETF, rose 1.15 percent to 786.20 tonnes on Tuesday, the highest since September 2014.In physical markets, India's gold imports in January surged 62 percent compared with the same period last year, news agency NewsRise Financial reported on Tuesday, citing a government official.",03-02-2016,Gold extends losses on robust US data higher shar,business
"strong>SYDNEY: Asian shares were bound for a third straight session of gains on Thursday as upbeat data on US jobs and a rally in a range of commodities whetted risk appetites globally.</strongNotably, oil shrugged off record high US crude stockpiles as investors chose to focus on an OPEC plan to freeze production, keeping alive talk the market had bottomed from a near two-year selloff.US crude edged up a further 9 cents to $34.75 a barrel, while Brent also rose 9 cents to $37.02.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added another 0.9 percent to reach a seven-week top, having surged 2.6 percent on Wednesday.Higher prices for copper and iron ore helped Australian stocks rise 0.8 percent to their highest in almost two months. Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.8 percent, on top of a 4-percent jump the previous session.""Value is starting to snap back and some sectors that pretty recently were hanging around all-time lows are showing signs of life,"" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.""The general updraft in oil is helping confidence as well. Investors aren't yet ready to take on a lot of risk, but they are adding to their positions.""Energy and bank stocks had led Wall Street higher on Wednesday, giving the Dow a gain of 0.2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.41 percent and the Nasdaq 0.29 percent.The calmer mood showed in the CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, which closed at its lowest level so far this year.Sentiment was underpinned by a report showing US private sector jobs rose a surprisingly strong 214,000 in February, adding to speculation Friday's payrolls report would also be upbeat.strong>NOT SO FAST</strongYet fissures remain in the global outlook, argued Justin Fabo, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank.Despite the latest bounce in commodities, prices were still very weak and a lot of money had been borrowed on the assumption that they would not be.""China has huge potential to roil markets as the nation navigates a difficult structural transition,"" he said. ""Asian trade, traditionally a bellwether for global growth, is in recession.""""Risk is being repriced, and the ability of central banks to keep pulling rabbits out of the hat is now pretty limited.""Indeed, there are plenty of worries the European Central Bank could disappoint expectations for aggressive easing when it meets next week - just as it did in December.Back then markets reacted violently when the central bank's stimulus steps stopped far short of what had been priced in, leading the euro to rocket 3 percent in just one session.Fearing a re-run, investors are holding back on shorting the euro, keeping it at $1.0871 and off a one-month trough of $1.0825. The dollar also faded a little on the yen to 113.70, after losing grip of a two-week high at 114.56.Instead, the limelight was stolen by the Australian dollar which neared its 2016 peak in the wake of surprisingly strong domestic economic data.The Aussie was taking in the view at $0.7306, up 0.3 percent on the day following a 1.7 percent rally on Wednesday.Investors warmed to the currency after data showed fourth quarter economic growth unexpectedly picked up to a healthy 3.0 percent annual clip.",03-03-2016,Asia shares scale seven week ,business
